In case you fail to miss the OBVIOUS....it's too loud.

besides my studio is still in pieces right now from the flood that tore through here.

BAH!

half my shit is ruined. hahaha....what's new with that, hey?

umm, this was done with all old time legacy gear.  No plug ins, no native nothing, just an old Pro Tools rig (""project"" mind you...from another lifetime) and a key board.  Well, and someone's cardiac test but we won't go into how I got a hold of the audio on that.

that's it really.  There are no FX on it and I tossed most of the original tracks as they sorta...well...sucked. Tried to redo the EQ on trent's vocals from the pigface master as it was VERY BADLY RECORDED.

i just wanted to say that in BIG EFFING LETTERS. hahaha....

there's only so much you can do with it though. He has a lot more bottom end to his voice than I thought he would.  Don't know why I'm writing that here necessarily, but it just crossed my mind now thinking about that HORRIBLE EFFING TRACK. hehehe...  

I'm kidding.  It was bad, but I've heard worse.
...just not often.
;)

wow...I just realized I started this rambling bit with the statement ""no comments really"".

unsurprisingly off base.

ahhh well.

this was actually good fun.  If I didn't limit myself to the tools/instruments I used on it, it probably would've gone a completely different direction.

Firstly, whenever I hear the song hurt, I feel as if it was written from the thoughts of someone who has given up
wants to be forgotten and is now heavily sedated on the fifth floor of a hospital staring at rubber walls.
for anyone who has actually been on those kind of heavy meds, or walked through those halls, the sound of this track may bring back some memories
I admit this recording is VERY rough, ( I did it on a webcam lapelle microphone in two tries)
~There were only TWO recorded tracks, one acoustic guitar and one vox NO SYNTHESIZERS.
~They were split into three seperate tracks
~one of each were left clean and put in the far background
~one of each were vocoded and the other bitcrushed (ONly two effects, thats all).
So if this track made you feel like your on a lot of drugs and have lost your mind than it has done what I have intended it to.
Flame away....."

Some small guitarparts are from ""I do not want this"".
And i played a little melody you should know in the break of this remix ;-D (And I had this idea before i listened to the year zero remix-album). I  also used some parts of the original suck (the synth parts from the beginning). All samples where timecorrected ,so that they fit one tempo (104 BPM) Everything else is new composed and all performed by myself. I wouldn't label it as a mashup because there are too less parts of ""down in it"" (They where just fun to fit in)...

Thanks

If I had to pick one of the favorite songs off The Downward Spiral, I'd have to pick this one.

So, sitting at my desk going hours without sleep on a Summer evening (and I stood up 'till like, 4:00 AM), got me a crappy glitch remix. Me no like, my friend no like. Just a couple effects splashed on, and soon I deserted my piece of shizz I can't even give the description of good to.

Back at my desk MONTHS LATER, I started getting into Industrial music even more and more, and I brought out the Closer song again, saying, ""What the hey, take another stab!""
I brought out everything distortion and glitch. Retriggers are always fun! And more EARRAPE!

Although my remix was more focused on the distortedness, I slapped a couple Jungle and DnB elements to it. The Jungle beat is a nice touch giving it that more ""faster"" and ""omgimrippingtrenttopieces"" feeling. rawk.

My piece was finished in a couple days, only because I worked on this non-stop. And when I could, I'd try and find an excuse to work on this. It just seemed to get better and better after a couple tweaks and a tad of destruction.

So, please. Don't listen if you have seizures."

It's that smell that brings me back,
everytime i open that door
When it's cold out, you can smell it.
White surrounds me, but it's raining.
Naked trees remind me of that one season,
of that one smell.
The clouds line the skies above.
A sunny day would be nice.
just as you went, the sun came out
Wake UP! the sun is shinning for you...



For mom.

So this is my take on his song, I renamed it for this version to go with my lyrics.  I've been working on this and another song of his for quite awhile now. I'm mixing on this unholy peice of shit otherwise this track would have been done awhile back, more collaberations with zwakk tunes on the way and more of my own.

Everything I put together is done manually and I rely on my ears %100.  I hold a huge collection of samples all kept on data CD.  So from 1998 to now you can only image how many loop disc I have.  The reason why I do this is simple.  You never know when you have a sample that will fit a song perfectly.  You are always better off saving them.  I have been using Acid software since 1998 as my master.  I am a seven string guitar player and I did not loop my guitar parts on this song.  It was recorded live.  Once the drums and fx are complete then they go on my Boss digital recorder and guitars are put on.  For me I find it easier to complete the drums & fx first, then bass, guitars & vocals last.  Nine Inch Nails has always been my favorite band and the music has always inspired me to try new things.  A Burning will be recorded again.  I have been side tracked by other projects, but I will re-do it in the future."

So I haven't posted anything for awhile, here's another one of my band songs until I can get the better stuff done, this isn't Industrial it's more Rock, expect more Industrial songs in the future.  All these will appear (most will be better versions) on my final album which will be online for free, keep up with us and the album status at www.vampirefreaks.com/mutagen

So I added German Vocals to 'Ghost 31'. I put the lyrics here in german and english so you can all understand it :)
maybe i won't translate it literally, but anyway:



English:

I turn her on
when my head tells me
just go on like this
and we'll be dead

she is the half-full bottle
in my chest
she poisons me
piece by piece

i hate her
and she loves me so much
i love her
and she hates me just a little bit more

she punches me the happieness
right in the face
she exploits me
but in the next moment

she gives me everything back twice
but only awhile
i am so happy
that i can live at least for some seconds

i am so lonley - without you
i am so lonley - without you
i am so alone - without you
i need you my livingmachine


German:

ich schalte sie an
wenn der kopf mir droht
mach nur so weiter
dann sind wir beide tot

sie ist die halbvolle flasche
in meiner brust
sie vergiftet mich
stÃ¼ck fÃ¼r stÃ¼ck

ich hasse sie
und sie liebt mich so sehr
ich liebe sie
und sie hasst mich immer ein stÃ¼ck mehr

sie schlÃ¤gt mir freude
mitten ins gesicht
sie nutzt mich aus
doch im nÃ¤chsten moment schon 

gibt sie mir alle doppelt
nur fÃ¼r kurze zeit zurÃ¼ck
ich bin so glÃ¼cklich 
das ich wenigstens ein paar sekunden leben kann

ich bin so einsam - ohne dich
ich bin so einsam - ohne dich
ich bin so allein - ohne dich
ich brauche dich - meine lebensmaschine"

and some have asked me about the words in the chorus...the world ending with moral decay...
this is not from an outside perspective like ""people are fucked..everybody change and make the world better"" but from an inside perspective...i'm   saying it because i'm the fucked up one..
now that i think about it ..this song really doesn't belong here at all...but like my girlfriend will tell you..i'm used to sticking things in the wrong place or just where they don't belong.."

I'm starting to work on an album or EP of all new songs (which I'll post many tracks here of course)  But in the mean time here's a song I made a few years ago.  The lyrics don't really apply to how I feel now (I'm engaged), but it's still a good song.  Before you write your reviews, the reason it says demo is that the vocals are not the best (especially the super loud ""Yeeaaa"" part which my friend James seems to thing is hilarious) and the drums need work and it needs more synths.  Let me know what you think, keeping in mind that it's a demo.  Thanks, my e-mail is: mutagenrocks@yahoo.com if anyone wants to say hi."

This is really one take, I have such a hard time writing lyrics that I had to pound like 6 beers to even get a few verses out of me. It's a mp3 so its not 64bits at max VBR, not that most of you peasants understand that shit, maybe Shahab hes probably a sith lord by now from my teachings. Drugs are for real.

H

Why I'm Better:

Its like one two three
If you come with me
I'm a show you the way to tranquility
This is how it goes down
W-T-G its our town
Fort Collins Colorado
Mother fuckers
You live in LA
You live in New York
You want us to buy
Some of your shit
But that just don't work
And I'm a tell you
This is what we say
When you Mother fuckers get to close to me today

I'm a Kill you if you look at me the wrong way
I'm a show you just the shit that you should say
I'm a kill you if you look at me the wrong way
Today

I'm just gonna say some fuckin crazy shit mother fuckers
This is where I break it down
Let me hear that shit
That's the synth from Umbrella
And I fuckin stole it

And that's the synth from a real Song

Headphones in the control booth
And mother fuckers you can see me move this shit
I'm a take you right now
This is how it goes down
Mother Fuckers
Fort Collins Colorado
Our Town
I'm a fucking show you
As The Snow Falls Off the Mountains
You could see Us
Right Here
And They Ain't Gonna Stop Us...


Ok so this is a forewarded email, and you all know I love the ninremix community because I love nin and you all are some of the best musical perspectives that I know. Leave some comments, say I suck because it's a freestyle, but there's only like three people on this site that have that right to own me. Riot Act you are one of them. 

half of you hentai fools who are non productive, I just want to say, I've lived with you and watched you play DOD for like 13 hours a day. I eat drugs and write music to entertain your asses. It's time you ate some psilo.

Nothing you can say to me. Nothing you can say at all. Nothing you can say to me. There's nothing left.

This little pig was thrown away. This little pig he never woke up today. This little pig he had cancer. This little pig he wasn't much of a dancer. This little pig he slit his wrist. This little pig he pulled the trigger and missed. This little pig let's say he was born with no bones. This lilttle pig he never had a home."

Sitting here upsidedown
I'm looking at clouds
falling off the ground
I said it alound
If I turn around
I can see it further away
everything is perfect
If you believe its the same

They can say it
But they will never understand
They keep fighting
But they will never understand
They can see it
But they will never understand
They can say it
But they will never understand

Half my head is hanging out
The glass is frosted
I have no doubts
The air up here is clean
Higher off the street
They will never know what it means
to fly you need wings
to fly you need wings
to fly you need wings
to fly you need wings
And higher up off the ground
I can see what they mean now
But It wont stop me
I'm too proud

Looking out my window I can see the ground
Falling down further I look up at the clouds
Looking out my window I can see the ground
Falling down faster further falling from clouds

There is cold on my chin there is ice all around
Everything is falling the walls closing down now
Empty weight on my chest freezing cold like my breath
Staring down through the window I can see
 
My light is fading away
My life is fading to gray

Ive been waiting so long to see the
Light at the end of the tunnel
I have Been waiting
For So Long
All I can see
I wont fade away

Everyday takes a little bit more
Brought to my knees
Brought to the floor
The more I let go
The more that I want it
The more that it matters

After everything that Ive been through
Ill hold on
This is for you

    The verse drum pattern was created by mistake when certain beats did not track as played.  Then the song became an exercise in layering sparse counter melodies, syncopated rhythms, and lyrical phrasing in such a way as not to sound busy, thus allowing the groove to breathe enough that hopefully the listener focuses less on its intricacies and more on the intended ambiance.  Wow!  How's that for an arrogant description of a 3 minute, tongue-in-cheek pop song?

When they come up fast
I drop that clip
Can you rock it like that
Do you flick your wrist
When you tip your hat
Can you rock it like that?
Do you make them pay
If they raise the stakes?
Do you leave them low
Do you make them wait
Before you wreak havoc

You can't stand against me
I am professionally
Trained and equiped
To deal with you quick
There will be prices to pay
If you make a mistake
If you give me that chance
I will have it

You build a mountain
I'll erase it
I've got the time
I've got the Patience
If you leave an opening
I will take it

I hope you thought
Long and hard
Before you pushed it this far
Because I won't stop when you see
Where we are
There will be prices to pay
If you make a mistake
If you give me that chance
I will have it
There will be prices to pay
If you make a mistake
If you give me that chance
I will have it

You build a mountain
I'll erase it
I've got the time
I've got the Patience
If you leave an opening
I will take it"

I shut my eyes

I used to have a DJ residency at a few local clubs, and I always wanted a more ""playable"" version of Hurt for the dance-floor, but without destroying the original mood and feel.

I worked from the original CD, sampling and using notch-filters to isolate specific sounds. I tried to t only sample a few key bars, and the original guitar chords to stay within the boundaries of legality. I added a total of 14 additional instruments/ tracks of my own device to create this new piece.

I meant to submit the remix directly to Trent Reznor, but never worked up the courage. I never intended to resell, or make profit from this remix - it was for my use. I have never redistributed this to anyone.

After possessing this song for years, and having played it at several clubs with great success (everyone always want s a copy) -- I figure that now, 8 years later after having made it... it should go out into the wild (with permission of Trent and associated NIN staffers).

I sincerely hope you like it. I put a lot of heart and effort into this."

i tweaked around with an audio granulizer plugin to get some weird effects.  imported a live performance of ""Reptile"" from Woodstock 94 and tweaked around with it so much that you wouldn't guess that was being ""sampled"" i guess.

this was part of a one-year studio session that became a full length album (and arather not-so-greatly mixed one at that).

plans to re-record this and the rest of the album are underway in late 2011.  the album is called ""The Occult: Stories for 2012""

also: don't have much the melodic voice down or have space for ""scream"" parts... which is where an influence of death metal style vocals comes into play.  i'm better gifted with that i guess."

Ardelli (Unofficial Remix).mp3","146","3","10","S","0.208333","0.0208333","1313531710",,"0",NULL,NULL,"""A Drowning"" by How to Destroy Angels is a beautifully hypnotic song but I find the original mix hard on the ears.  After analyzing it through the TT Dynamic Range Meter I found the mix was squashed to death, particularly towards the end.

In my mix here, I purposely did not use any kind of compression either on any of the source tracks or on the final mix; I believe this results in much more ""natural"" sound.

If you don't think it's ""loud"" enough, well, that's what that control marked ""volume"" is for... :)

I also mixed the vocals in higher, and the ""FX"" in lower, than in the original mix.  The voice is truly lovely and I felt it deserved to be more ""center stage,"" and I felt the ""FX"" worked better when understated a bit rather than in your face.

So the bottom line is I didn't do anything dramatic here.  My intent was to capture the essence of the artists' original intentions but with a bit more dynamics and expressiveness.

For more information on my thoughts on sound mixing and the use of dynamic range:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-rRXKRSTvk

BTW, I apologize for the heavy artifacting towards the end during the final fade; because of the 7M file size limit I couldn't use a high enough bitrate to avoid it, particularly given the 7+ minute length of the song.

The original master is 24-bit uncompressed AIFF so if you'd like to hear a higher quality version I can create a new version at a higher bitrate in MP3, AAC or Apple Lossless if you'd like to hear it at, or closer to, the original quality."

If you'd like to hear a higher quality version of this, please email me at gelfling@syd.eastlink.ca

I did another remix of this song a couple years ago which is still on this site.  I did it because I felt the original mix was brutally squashed with dynamic range compression and felt I could make it sound a lot better.

So that first mix sounds more or less like the original song, just cleaner and less distorted.

This is basically the same mix except I added a sound effect of ocean surf.  The musical arrangement already brings to mind the image of someone struggling to stay afloat; I feel the ocean surf brings that image into clearer focus."

"3","3","10","This remix from start to finish kicks some serious ass, and then some. I find myself listening to it over and over. Using just the album version XAI Project has taken this great song and just obliterated it in kick ass drums and transitions. A+++ imo. Great work!","0"

"5","7","10","I thought i was on some kind of \""Narcotic\"" when i first heard this one,  meaning that there was no way it sounded this good, but low and behold it is that good.  no kidding here,  it almost enough to make me want to never touch the computer myself again.  i was amazed at the layers and creativity that pulls this one together.  i dont review hardly any remixes but this one i couldnt resist not doing. 

liten to it!!! it wont let you down.

great track S.N.

"6","7","9","Wow. When I opened up this song in iTunes I figured it would be a poorly done remix with things all jumbled together and whatnot. In a few places things seem to get a bit rough with the vocals but it\'s definetly an amazing remix. There are two things I\'m wandering though, 1) how did you get the vocals to sound as though you cut them from and accapella track? 2) what software did you use to cut this remix, it\'s much better then most of the things I\'ve heard done in ACID Pro. If you would like to answer these questions please email me at:

"14","3","8","A fierce DnB/Jungle beat, double time of the original, makes this better than the original (which I though was rather boring in the grand scheme of NIN), IMHO. Love the broken beat bit in the middle too! Nice work overall!

"12","21","8","hey there Bo! this is the 4th time in a row i think listening to this song lol. wanted to make sure i got most of the things =P i like the echo in the beginning. sounds like maybe 3 echos? and then the way the piano kinda sneaks up on ya lol. i like the piano. there are some times in the song where the beats b/n all the things aren\'t exactly sincronized, but overall it still sounds really good. i like all the background stuff. =) Good job

"13","7","10","damn. i hate to say it, but i almost like this mix better than the original! i didnt like the whole tamborine-thing from in the original version (eventually, it grew on me). this one has a much deeper feel to it, and i felt like i was immersed farther into the mood of the song. all the extra layers make it so bold, and having the original vocals i think compliments it perfectly. certain effects make it seem like a more grown-up version of an old song, very reminiscent of the pretty hate machine era, but much more modern. 

Well done!","0"
"16","2","10","This is the best remix on this site. By far. In fact it deserves to be on a NIN remix album.

The fiercest, most evil broken beat DnB, completely twisted audio terror. The production is professional, the sounds are nasty, the drums are set to \'obliterate\'...

"19","9","10","The is my favorite mix on here by 5ilent Narcotic. Slow and mellow in the begining. When the beat comes in with... \""now that I\'ve decided not to stay... makes you bounce and really gets you to stick with the song. i think i\'ve listened to this mix more than the original! beautiful job.","0"
"20","12","9","Almost perfect. First the good: overall, the song is extremely well performed and a wonderful reworking of the original on Halo 17.

Here\'s what I didn\'t like:
- The beginning is too noisy and too long (almost 30 seconds). This alone probably tuns off a number of people to the cover.
- At a few times it sounds like the vocals are out of key. Specifically from 2:15 to 2:42. They improve but still sound somewhat out of key until 3:10.

I absolutely love the rest and the song remains one of my favorite NIN covers. Thanks for sharing it with us!","0"
"21","29","9","Goosebumps....
Thats how i can explain this remix.... first two seconds sounds chopped off/faded and last two seconds are also faded but gets kinda loud... but!!! awesome work!
This is currently the only remix for \""Non Enitity\"" and yes, this is how i expected it to be... Can\'t wait for official release by Trent.","0"
"22","12","6","Good attempt.

It\'s a hell of alot better than most NIN covers, I\'d say worthy of one of those tribute cds but that\'s not really a compliment, but take it as one.

The piano is the best part of it, but the version runs a little too long.

I\'m not keen on the female vocals, I think if reorganized could be a very strong dub mix.","0"
"23","29","9","I was a skeptic at first considering TR\'s original acoustic performance. I must say, this remix was very much in line with my vision of total (completed) song. You do a great job of staying true to the songs emotional intergrity. Fantastic work, Sefiros!","0"

"29","29","10","When I started the song I though that it would just be a simple remix as it sounded the same as the original. I listened further in and started hearing the subtle changes and the revamping of almost every aspect up to trents voice. some small but evident echoing vocals were added which add a really nice touch. overall it has a much smoother feel than I expected and fits quite well with something I would see trent actually making.","0"

"33","37","3","Personaly the only real difference I could hear in this remix from the original Non Entity was the addition of Death Dealer\'s Descent done by Renholder. I think DDD was added in too loud and drowned Trent out a little.","0"

for the review,  first off,  man the selection of songs you mix is excellent by itself.

but the actuall work of the mix in and out with the multiple ideas and relations that they thrive off is amazNINg.  the explosion at 1.24 secs makes me wanna grab the nearest object_ and smash something with it.  excellent in and out fades new portions included = a complete reality of me putting this on a disc and taking it to the living room to burn_ my stereo equipment to the ground.....

thanks again,

I couldn\'t figure it out how you did with the instrumental part without hearing any metallic noises in the background.

"54","55","7","good remix....the filtered fx on the vocals were pretty cool as well as the new guitar distorsion. its nice too see something creative that isn\'t just clippings of NIN songs that are arranged over eachother in a sequencer. the one thing I would change about this mix tho is about halfway through it loses its energy and there is no build of elements, it gets a little stagnant and drops to an 7 from a 10.","0"

"63","25","0","Personally, I did not find this mix enjoyable at all.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that it completely ruined what was an awesome song.

It\'s not a bad concept, but the vocals were just so horribly nasal that I found the song unlistenable.  The vocals were entirely too loud as well.

Also, what is this song about?  It doesn\'t make any sense.  \""Tell me now, why you (word missing), hurry now... (something about hands around your throat)\"" 

Like I said, it could have been an interesting concept, but some songs are just best left without words. Now I will never be able to listen to The \""Persistence of Loss\"" without hearing those nasal, high-pitched vocals and incredibly cliche, emo lyrics in my head.  I have no idea how this song made it to the top of the list.","0"

"66","81","10","Wow... This remix is amazing.

I really got suckered in by the beat. But I believe the best part is the mixing of Trent\'s voice. Instead of making it sound cheesy and easily recognized as a mix, you made it flow and sound perfect.

I\'m sure if you presented this remix to a person who hadn\'t listened to the original song, they would never guess it was a remix, but an actual Nine Inch Nails song.

Be careful.. or Trent himself might try to steal this remix and pass it off as one of his own.

"73","82","10","A very unique and haunting rethinking of Only. This rendition gives a completly different feeling, and even a new view of what many of us have all come to know as the Disco track.

Vocally superb, harmonys in the later half of the track seemlessly blend together.

I can\'t quite put my finger on it, but the vocalist has the voice of Maynard, or Eddie Vetter, which at some points make you feel like you\'re listening to a cover by one of those more well known artists.

Dynamically, its smooth. Wouldn\'t change a thing there.

Very nice transitions and scene changes from acoustic to distortion, and also a very nice flow, keeping you interested throughout the track.

Theres quite a bit more that I could continue to compliment, but for those reading, I\'ll leave it for you to listen and decide for yourself.","0"

"75","82","5","first off, excellent mastering and recording.
I liked the different timing to the lyrics than the original.by about 1:25 it gets old, and after the chorus its almost like this artist took another song and dropped NIN lyrics in it and called it a cover. 

the chorus vocals are decent, but lack energy and the first \'me\' sounds a little off key. 

I really did like the song though and it is an excellent recording with great guitar, but i really have to wonder if it was a cover or just nin lyrics dropped in another song and matched with the timing. 9 on the music, but about a 3 as far as a cover goes, and about a 6 on the vocals.","0"
"76","81","9","Wow, what an unusual and well thought out remix. Usually I stray away from anything with \""remix\"" in the title, and that is the case with a lot of official NIN remixes as well. But this belongs on an official halo_ disc. You really made this tasteful and well presented.

I especially enjoy the piano harmonies, and the slight dissonant tension created in the beginning.
Interlacing Trent\'s voice and the rest of the song into your original composition is also very tactfully executed.

Good job. Can\'t wait to hear more :)","0"
"77","82","9","Awesome cover of only ... Very dark and creative , Sound quility is 100 % , Mastered n recorded very well , Nice intro and outro . Its dark n sad at the same time , which fits the song very well for a cover . I wish I could give it a 9.5 , but I cant , I think a 10 would be a little much cuz A 10 for me is a perfected mix like the perfect drug or were in this together . Witch is rare to find .Plus this cover lacks a little origanality , Cuz there is alot of bands with this kind of sound musicaly . But Im not downing it in any way . Its awesome , So thanks for the Cover guys . Keep on workin on a defining sound , and giving us kick ass covers .

"79","82","5","Howdy guys,

I have no idea how to comment on my own song so just giving a bit of a heads up.

LittleJon- The song was specifically written for this. I basically wanted to completely redo Only and make it into basically the opposite of the actual song. It was hard placing basically spoken word and changing it to fit some kind of a melody. I decided to do this for about half of With Teeth but then gave up becuase I got a little bored with the project hehe. Your comments are welcome. Looking back now, the vocals could have been MUCH better.

Sick Messiah- The cover/reimagining was done by me :) Thank you for the comment though. I was trying to achieve a band mechanic. I guess I kind of succeeded.","0"

"125","63","7","Interesting, describes it well. The orchestration is kind of cabaret, and the vocals never really pick up-- I would like this song much better if the voice became clearer, or louder. Also, the orchestration is a bit too simplistic. Otherwise, I actually enjoyed listening to this. Keep on trying~

My only problems are with the mix.  It could be a little more crisp.  I feel like the creators were trying to compensate for difficulties in syncing things up and mixing by drenching the it in reverb, as cover up what it lacked in texture.

That aside, this was great, better than most, to be sure.","0"

"1424","122","2","It basically sounds the same as the original song in the beginning, then suprises you at the first \'On hands...\', as it repeats it and fades, then comes back as the same song as the original again, but with a mixed backround. Bad way and choice to do a remix like that.","0"
"1448","9","8","Great choice to mix this one. We need to see more of less around here. I like the separation between the highs and lows, it gives it that industrial feel. But then there is this strange xylophone sound that comes in and turns me off from it. It doesnt work together. Crunchy doesnt mix with soggy too well this time. ","0"

"1743","184","7","ok.  I like the idea, but there\'s definitely some work to be done.  First, the intro:  You\'re hitting the right notes, but there\'s no dynamic quality.  certain notes need to be more pronounced (louder) than others and vice versa (softer)  Also, you\'re missing all the filling lines, that\'s what makes the originall so beautiful.  You\'re too fast as well.  It not the type of track you can use a metronome on.  It\'s about feeling when and where.  Perhaps give the piano a bit of reverb too.  When the heavy part kicks in, I like it a lot.  But still some piano filling is missed.  Lastly, that last note, your \&quot;climax\&quot; seems tacked on and abrupt.  If you want it, you need to offer some build up to it.  All in all, pretty good.  I like the choice. ","0"

No, this just doesnt sound good. Okay, i will try and find some good intelligent reasoning for my utter disgust by this song, but anything I say will be grossly ignored and unoticed in the same fashion as say, oh i dont know, aids in africa. Now, I dont want to make light of a terrible rampant disease, but i believe this is type of music heard far too much on my radio waves these days that rape the ears of my fellow man, and mine as well.

Here\'s the deal, it sounds good to the same people that are creating a market for the worst music ever created since poison, and boy band and the rebirth of modern jazz.

I cannot express enough how wrong this is especially in a forum where people reinterpret already stelar music by legendary rock hero T Reznor.

But I\'m not an unreasonable person, so what I want to see is you being better. Hell yes, you can be better, and you should be. I think that these people are fucking shep pandering to you and trust me they disgust me more than you.

"3040","190","7","Gritty.  \&quot;steel teeth\&quot; seems an apt title.  this remix grinds; i like it.

love the new riff.  love what you did with the \&quot;i cannot go through this again\&quot; part and how the noise comes crashing back afterwards.

the effect on the chorus kind of takes away the impact, in my humble opinion.

Would have given you an 8 (a 10 being a nine inch nails quality song), but the mix sounds a little muddy.  It adds to the mood, but personally I think it would still be gritty if everything were more clear.  Not necessarily the remixers\'s fault, though.  ","0"

I liked this rendition a lot.  you got the beat down and all of those spooky atmospheric moments from the original.  i gave it a 7 cause i would\'ve like to have heard the vocal bit near the end, as i believe it would have completed the progression of the song as i listened.

I dunno if I like what you did with the song to be honest. The chorus is lame.

"4320","164","7","IT's very good, however, it gives me the feel you were listening to Closer To God album while making it.
It's almost a loud and crackly deviation of, well, maybe Closer [Deviation].
Though at the last part it clearly indicates how it is different from Closer [Deviation].

Who is speaking? I couldn't quite hear.

Anyway, it's pretty good, as I've said before, but why drink sparkling cider when you have vintage champagne, you know?","0"
"4324","275","2","Ok, here's an unspoken rule for ya [that I think mostly applies]: no animal sounds in nin remixes unless the song is called closer, okay?
[No, wait, maybe pig noises would be ok in *fuckers.... whatever, I don't control the world. :( to that.]

[Alternately, NO using baby sounds IN the song Closer. That's just, er-hem WEIRD.]

As for you song...since it's starfuckers, I kinda expected it to be noisier and louder. Very good in the beginning, lost it's way on the end.
Hope you get better at Acid!","0"

Around 1:50ish, maybe earlier, when he starts singing, it's reminiscent of Freddy V. Jason, when the little girls are playing patticake and singing that, 'one, two, freddy's coming for you...' song.

this is very poor... it isnt really a rich sound of the piano and only playing it without expression isnt the goal... as longer as i hear this its a shame to destroy such great song by a version without emotion and expression at least in the volume of the piano...

Maybe it was a programming error or whatever, but it simply didn't work for me.

in my ears it sounds wrong...
also the ending is cutted...
wanted ? or unwanted ?
so i give you overall 9 points

"6376","36","7","Wow... for picking such a hard coverversion you have my full respect. This Cover Version has great Elements and cool Ideas. One criticism: 
for me is that the vibe-synth
sounds too nice to me... if it would have been a little bit less powerfull or shiny than it would contribute to the overall dark feeling of that song. And the piano would have needed a little bit more reverb for my taste.
But overall a good coverversion!

"9053","442","4","In spite of the many excellent layering, panning, and editing effects - and for all of its subtle nuances - I wish more happened with this track.  You have achieved substantial minimalism, and the track works fine in this regard.  But as a listener, experiencing your sounds, I wish they led somewhere.  I don't feel the progress of this track, fail to comprehend the melody (which isn't so important) and I wish you would do well to try throwing your percussive/noise loop through some filters.

Without context, it is hard to see the forest for the trees.

However, I think you have some very exciting and raw sounds.","0"
"9054","443","2","You take your listening to some very interesting places, and never fail to find a way to open up ears and close them just as quickly.  To be perfectly frank, I enjoyed the piano/synthclav(?) interlude here.  

Your drum loop, after the bizarre false-start at the beginning, is in my opinion, unlistening.  This may or may not be a compliment or constructive critique, as i really don't know what you were trying to do here.  but you ought to know that the ear-splitting resonance of your drum loop, its sheer monotony, and lack of rhyme or reason, communicates two things to me, as a listening:

a) you are trying to experiment.  its cool.  please keep working as I see enourmous potential in your music.  keep in mind that if you want to safeguard your ears and that of those volunteering to listen, you need to watch those frequencies 2khz through 4khz.

b) you have utter disdain for your audience.  i'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that this is not the case, but if it is, then I guess I'm a sucker.  I listened to your entire track, and now I feel I must apologize to both my ears and my waking mind.","0"
"9055","431","3","I see what you were trying to do here, and at certain points the effects and editing take some very interesting turns.

I wish you had done more structurally to this song.  I don't think its enough to run the song through some filters and call it a remix.  maybe some other synth parts, maybe a new beat, perhaps a track with an identifiable rising and falling of energy over a period of time.

yes, tons of effects, but after a while i don't know what i'm hearing, and its almost like effects for effects-sake.

also, on a personal note and having no bearing on the artistis merit of your remix, I wish you had left Mike Garson's incredible piano solo alone.  Sort of sounds like thats the part of the CD you start to fast-forward thru.  Thats just me, though.","0"
"9056","441","5","A very interesting track.  Some odd, magic moments.  Almost beautiful.  considering your self-described musical ability, one of the more interesting experiments on here, and not at all a waste of time to listen to.  keep it at, and most importantly, keep challenging yourself.  I have a feeling the best sounding parts of this tracks were the hardest to pull off.","0"
"9071","439","8","I swear, I review every Leaving Hope remix. LOL Anyways, I like what I hear. Aside from the weird breaks you mentioned I really have one thing. But this is just my opinion. You need to put more emphasis on the Piano. The Bass notes really drowns it out. (And yes, my speakers are set up right. lol) Because to me, the Piano is what makes this song. So maybe turn up the volume on the Piano? All in all, great work!","0"

"9205","444","4","pretty standard pop/rock sound.  maybe it would have hit big in the 90's, but it sounds a tad dated.  also, while the vocals are not terrible, the voice itself could use more refinement, and does not sit well in the mix.","0"

"9322","447","4","While the ideas behind the song are not terrible, there is a lot in the execution of the thing that bothers me, personally.  the singing is off from time to time, and that heavy reverb isn't changing anything.  lyrics aren't all that bad, they work with the minimal style of the song.  your synth patches sound like factory presets.  if they aren't, you should put a little more effort into the individual sounds.  and try to synchronize any arps with have going with the beat.

keep it minimal with more of an emphasis on each layers, each sound.  otherwise, an good effort.","0"
"9323","449","8","Techincal errors aside, this is a really incredibly decent song.  there are obviously minor performance hiccups here and there, some rough mix issues.

reminds me of radiohead to an extent.  the piano and the guitar, once it has tastefully arrived later on, are my favorite elemtnes.  whereas so many people try to emulate another song instead of going out into new territory, i'd say you've done anything but a straight-up emulation of anything i can recognize.  

i enjoyed this song and i believe it is one of the best originals up here.  keep it up.","0"

"9367","444","10","First off thanks for the kind words Finneus.  In response to the others our sound is based off of 90s and 80s bands primarily, I do listen new music all the time though (mostly underground, some mainstream). My girlfriend agrees (with Kyle) that it sounds 90s.  But I'm really not bothered by that, I think bands should play what they want rather than try to sound modern.  I thought I'd put our stuff up here since NIN is a huge inspiration on my songwriting and easily one of my favorite bands (Along with Nirvana, KMFDM and many others). Some songs I posted sound more Industrial (like Burnt Out) we try lots of styles (as future tracks I  post will show).  This studio recording was rushed because of money, the mixing is not the best, also I could have done better on the vocals with more time, so I agree on those points.  If we ever get a chance to rerecord it I'll put it up here.  Obviously Daniel didn't like it which is fine, I don't mind your opinion, a lot of people I've given this song to (or who have seen our shows) enjoy it, some people don't like our music.  Nobody can seem to ever agree on what's good music, movies, books, etc. anyway so I understand that.  But about the pop appeal thing what I don't get is if you don't like pop appeal why do you listen to NIN?  Pretty Hate Machine is a pop record, Trent even said so himself, and his other albums still have those pop hooks that keep the song stuck in your head, even though there under 20 layers of strange noise it's still there.  Anyhow thanks to all for reviewing, no hard feelings just giving my 2 cents.","0"
"9368","387","10","Alright I don't listen to emo music or whatever.  I haven't seen a lot of people on this site be flat out rude but thanks for singling me out.

"9484","451","8","definitely needs the vox, but not much else.  i go as far as to say your chorus beat is almost a little to similar to &quot;the line begins to blur.&quot;  but you could have chosen something worse to emulate.  overall nice synth work, great lead arp but you may want to subtly spice it up in the second verse (light, delayed distortion with a high-pass filter, like its on fire.)  very impressed with those snare fills.  the beat is nice, your drums sound fine - perhaps a little less distortion.  you can show 'em off, its fine.  everything is really nicely put together, planned, understood from the get go.  awesome.","0"

1) The vocals could be a bit louder, perhaps even with a little less reverb on them.

I don't care if you don't like the song but you are wrong about your assumptions, I'm into a lot of underground Industrial like Chemlab, KMFDM, etc.  omgktk Nevermind your still in your own little world where everyones a trendy but you, grow up.","0"

"9749","457","8","I Just Thought I'd give you my 2 cents. The Song Is still great but as I said on the other version, It's better without vocals. I'm not a fan of Kyle Porter's Voice. Not many people on this site can do decent vocal work. No offense to Kyle. If You feel it needs more, try adding some more piano to the rest of the song. Or maybe some Guitars.

"9870","29","8","My biggest gripe is that I can track the original piece, there wasn't much arrangement.  That's the worst I can say about this remix though, it's freakin great!  There is a creative blend of sounds and tones used.  Even a few well placed disharmonious and distorted points, which are truly the hallmark of industrial and NIN.

Brilliant work!","0"

"9878","460","8","This was a strong effort, and there was obviously a lot of creativity in its creation and chose instruments!

I'd like to make a couple of observations though.

1. Check your levels.  Everything more or less had the same tonal quality.

2. The crescendos were kind of there, but they weren't truly committed.  As you'll recall, the original had hugely dramatic crescendos, which is what really gave the song it's power.","0"

"13802","511","10","At first I found myself wondering what Kyle Porter meant when he titled this song Sedition. 
But after a few moments I was able to stop contemplating labels and enjoy something that appears more personal than superficial.
I will be examining this song in greater depth. This effort deserves no less!
Kyle Porter is, I realize, a substantial talent.  
What is exciting is that there seems no end in sight!
Sedition by Kyle Porter earns my highest recommendation.","0"

"13939","519","9","This is one I especially like. I wasn't a big fan of this song until I heard the chorus, then I  played the whole thing and decided it was (one of) my favorite/s. Great job, any chance of a re-recording? I think your voice was a little too loud over the music, but maybe it's just me...

I think this would be good for a soundtrack, also.","0"
"13960","519","5","I really like the structure of the this song, the production is pretty good.  Some really great musical moments in your arrangment, lots of movement and energy.

As for vocal, I hate your microphone, whichever you are using.  U need a condenser, something cheap like an AKG.  It'll sound a ton better.  Also, your voice is not the worst I've ever heard, but your singing sounds sluggish, like Peter Murphy doing The Offspring.  Maybe its the inherent quality of your voice or the way you push air from your lungs.  In any case, doubling the vocals won't always excite them enough.  

Otherwise, really very nice work.  You are an incredibly decent songwriter.","0"

'Here's a remix from the ninremixes.com collective that I found to be quite good. Like the creator, i too always wanted an upbeat remix of 'Something I Can Never Have' as it was *the* song that truly turned me onto a continuos love/hate relationship with NIN while camping at a lake with exploding cans of spraypaint thrown into the campfire - I'll save the story for another day. While this track is good, it is only a cover.

I didn't give it a 10 because it left me wanting some sort of climax that never came. I think it would be awesome if you just pulled out all the stops and went crazy with a guitar at the end or something. otherwise as just a flowing ambient/emotional track I do really like it and would prob give it a 10 for that purpose.","0"
"16827","698","10","thanks, this track is my first attempt at using some of the new sounds I got in the Arythmia sound bank set released by Jerome Dillon and Keith Hillebrandt. works great with the new alesis drums.

"16958","713","9","Wow, I hope to write my own songs at this level. I love the stutter fx and and lushifier type effect on the synth/guitar. To be critical as we always are to better eachother, there were a few percussion hits towards the beginning that I felt were too loud for the mix since they hit so hard with high end. and maybe its just the original version that left me wanting for a harder climax where shit just goes more crazy at the end.

I think you introduced a little too much near the beginning of the song that made it just a bit draggy towards the end; I guess what I mean is that by the first chorus, the song is done building, and personally, I would build a little more tension throughout the second verse and chorus.

"17144","735","7","This is actually pretty well done, give yourself a little credit.  

Personally, I would add some more effects and emphasis on the vocals.  Maybe vary the beat a little bit as well.  Just subtle variations from bar to bar to hold the listener's attention.

The vocals are very thoughtful and unique -- the song as a whole gives me a Beck meets Zero Sum meets Fitter Happier by Radiohead feel, which is good.  

You did a good job but a little more effort in production would make this song even better.  All in all, good work and I'd love to hear more.

I hope that helps.","0"
"17145","733","10","The production on the vocals is really smooth.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.

"17150","739","10","thanks, I'm trying to keep writing until I have enough to release a solo album of 10 or so songs on absynce.com (if I can ever learn how to program in html lol) so I keep releasing every small freestyle session to this site to see which ones are better and if I should keep and polish up any of them. It's good to have other people that write listen and critique because you value their opinions more since they know how long it takes to put a track together. which btw I think it's crazy the amount of material you release on this site, and the time it must take to do that","0"
"17174","739","10","First of all, let me say that I get geniunely excited when I see a new original tune up here by you, so that's gotta say something in itself.

Not listening on the best speakers ever at the moment but the beat is easy to get into, and the subtle hooks in vx and synth keep you listening even though the beat is fairly simple.  It builds very nicely.  

It's honestly a shame it ended when it did -- The ending was unique but took the surrealism out of the song, I would pull the little speech out; that's just my opinion though.

Ok so reviewing...  Beat is fantastic, destroyed fx and synths are fantastic, vocals as a whole are fantastic (listening on Bose QuietComforts and hearing drowned vocals in the beginning).  The only complaint I have is the length -- it's a little short.  It's a freestyle though, so I understand.  If you're looking for the go-ahead or approval to put a little more work into it, you have it ten-fold.  This kind of stuff is right up my alley, and I know I'm not the only one.

Perhap's as time goes on I will better able to understand your perspective and how the titles and links to gear relate. Giving you an honest 5 on this because it's decent. I know you are gonna give us more and better still to come.
Good luck!

Maybe it's because I met and sat with you guy's but hearing Grant discuss the intricacies of a smiling _wat and then burst out laughing made me totally crack up. Very funny shit my friend! Ha ha you talking too. I could just picture the look on Grant's face and you who rarely makes eye contact and speaks very deliberately in person and on the phone.
Ha ha, if you guy's say M_ke is a p_s_y that is good enough for me. YOU two shot PUS_SY M_ke!!!!
Anyways, Josh you and Grant are two of the sic-est, koolist, trippy-est dudes I have ever met. Sic, sic evil fucks you two belong on the coast man. The City would be perfect for you two.

@Randall
Thanks so much for taking the time to explain all that to me.  I could definitely use some better gear... ASIO does a pretty good job of controlling latency-- I'm down to 12ms or so recording, I just need to break the vocal chords in a bit better.  I'd love to hear your work.","0"
"19272","826","9","Your mastering is great as always makes me want to try audition. I liked the environment. the first verse of vocals hit me wrong maybe it was the lyrics, the second ones that came in with the fuzzed image overlaying them panned slightly left and right I liked better and then the vocals clicked in more for the rest of the song. the general song and electronics were good but I think it could be improved on with a traditional instrument like a guitar or piano melody and maybe a repeating type chorus vocal part of the track. but as a general art piece that aims at the ethereal and that type of vibe I like it the way it is, I guess it just depends on what you were going for.","0"

"19337","32","1","well what can be said about a old song recorded with the absolutely the cheapest and minimal equipment possible back in 99 . It Sucks !!! It has is good sounds .. And im not to ashamed to have made it at 15 years old and just getting into the idea of making music . Now its been 10 years and im about to have a real functioning studio for the first time in my life . Way more interesting NIN inspired stuff coming soon . I dought anybody will care ..... Yet ","0"
"19338","52","8","Well in retrospect of having a big part in this song . I like it alot more now .. Jon a.k.a starfukker and &quot; Digital Syn &quot; sent me some freestyle Piano he recorded . It was staticy and recorded with a mic off of a keyboard .
It was around 10 minutes long and i narrowed it down with my favorite parts .. the Concept was about a guy like me at the time .. Depressed and wanting to let go of life . he would then sit at the bottom of a dried up reservoir durring a long thunderstorm with heavy downpore ... He would then sit and wait for the reservoir to fill .. And slowly let himself drown without a fight . Without a care .. He doesn't even move .. I used a few noise filters on the track , and a dynamic EQ , and a few samples of storms and water being poored .. I then seqenced them in order .. Like a lake filling up ...  Now there is a nine Inch nails song after this was made called Lights in the sky ... With lyrics saying &quot; watching you drown , Ill follow you down  , and i am here right beside you &quot; .. I sometimes wonder if Trent himself was inspired by this .. If so .. A NINinspiration caused a Faninspiration .. Full circle ..","0"
"19339","698","9","Awesome .. I like alot .. reminds me of germany before ww2 .. Kinda scary ..","0"
"19340","826","8","Very good , and the song getts better as it goes along .. Big ups to you for using a shitty laptop mic and making the best of it .. The only downside is the scale you use for your vocals .. Try mixing it up more , and dont be scared to sing in a lower octive .. Widen you scale with your vocals and but a mic , a compressor/limiter , and maybe a vocal effects processor , and a interface/soundcard with zero latency monitoring, and you will be less limited and your songs im sure will be a 10 each time .. Sounding good during production is way less time consuming then post production .. I have beaten dead horses for years , i know  .. On another note ..

Dude i use the same 2 programs for my project sick messiah .. getting a presonus firestudio soon to fight latency .. Anyhow with the right setup you can rewire FL8 into a track on adobe ... Do you do this ??","0"

You've got a good voice and I'm not saying to take lessons or anything but if there was one aspect that could be improved it would be that. So i dont know if it conflicts with what your original intent of the song, but adding better vocals that really stress communication of the words would help. Again, i know you know ur stuff and ur not monotone or anything, but i think thats where the problem lies. Otherwise, i like it and feel free to use the site as a testing ground.","0"
"26800","5","5","This is my remix. Figured I'd give a little background. In 2000 NIN was holding a contest to remix this track. They had a flash app up on their site with something like 8 tracks that all played at the same time. You basically had a volume slider for each track, you hit play and mixed on the fly hoping you were sliding a certain track up at the right time. lol. Very little control. Not like these guys who are remixing stuff from source tracks NIN released in later years.

Anyway. I did this mix on the fly and recorded it to my minidisk while I was doing it. Later I recorded back to my machine and a few years later decided to submit it to ninremixes. If I remember right, it was the first &quot;The Big Come Down&quot; remix submitted to the site. 

I'm not a musician and I don't even pretend to be. I make indie films so if I ever do audio mixing it usually involves just dialog. In fact I don't even think I submitted this mix to the contest because I just didn't feel confident enough about it. 

I have a sneaking suspicion though, that some of these other remixes of The Big Come Down have used my version (along with the original song) as part of their source material. Which is totally cool. More than cool actually, because if true, it makes me feel good I could help out.

Well this is a big stupid mistake on my part. How do I rectify this?
By the way here is my explanantion, umm, not it matters.
During the last two weeks I downloaded the multitracks for Burn. 
Thought they would be in Garageband format but were in Flac instead. So I converted in Audacity and also cropped length sure that it would be no problem to align by ear. Subsequently it was a problem. Imported your track from my iTunes intending to use it to align the vocals in my mix project. Wanted to find that power spot where TR says I'm gonna burn this whole thing down. 
Damn I thought I muted/deleted but just opened project and there is your song minus the middle.

"27573","935","7","Sounds a little better than the last mix...vocals sync up a bit better, though still at times seem out of place.

As for the &quot;remix/inspired&quot; debate, however, to me this is still a remix. Fan-inspired songs, in my opinion, are a projects that artists/bands have pieced together with programming, vocals, instruments, etc., made by them. If this were to be vocals of his from HtDA, that may be one thing, but since these are samples from a NIN song, I'd have to put this in the Unofficial category.

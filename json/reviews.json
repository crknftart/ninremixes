Love the warping in the vocals at the beginning. at :54, i cannot wait for whats next. amazing intro, maybe best ive heard. i dont mind the stuttering at all. its creatively used. good vocal processing, and you minimized it and didnt overdo it. good work there. the throbbing beat is good. by 2:25, its really getting going. love the roll into 3:00 and the first chorus. good work there. i can hear all sorts of things going on in the background still, thanks for keeping it. all sorts of layers here. into chorus 2, great work there too. piano is louder and necessary. i like the way you fit everything in, nothing is out of place or sticking out. so it looks like you spent awhile doing this and really knocked it dead. there are absolutely no parts of this that i get bored, or can guess what comes next. keeps me wanting more. watch out clubs, this is the killer re-remix! \r\n\r\n9.3 out of 10","account":"0"},

{"id":"11","song":"50","rating":"8","review":"sefiros, only_recollection:\r\nintro, good so far, nice tension and build up. not that every song has to have that, but its good that you put this in there. kick comes in and fits nicely, almost like a heartbeat (might want to intentionally make it a heartbeat by putting another kick a 16th note behind it?) pianos are good, they also fit. good so far. really good tension, then the beat kicks in. main vocals come in with guitars, still fits. well done there too. voice could have a little more reverb i think so that its in the same neighborhood as the rest of the instruments. does 2nd verse come in too quickly? not sure. good vocal editing there. by 3:25, im not sure that the music is going the same direction as the vocals. i like the music, but somehow not the vocals. slap back echo drums are a little too far back, might want to bring the wet\/dry mix a little drier. good programming of drums though. by now im reminded that the main line hasnt stopped or broken. might consider some kind of break, pause, whatever in there between something like verse and verse or verse and chorus. not sure. this is definitely good music score material, so well done there. by 5:30, im really wishing for a break or something in the buzz thats going, and i think my ears want the \"searching, frustrated\" sound to lead to something new and fresh, not sure is.\r\nis this really all there is is well placed, but the music is still the same. it seems like this would be the perfect point to change the melody to something else entirely? maybe thats just me. ok, now we have 16 repetitions of that, im not sure if thats a tad too many.\r\nwoah. at 7:48, this part of the mpeg really hoses winamp! good job on that! oh, you probably didnt mean that. might want to re-encode that.\r\nhmmm. finally got to the ending. dont get me wrong, the music is GOOD, but im not sure that it needs to be that sad, especially at the end. i think of this song as more of a \"declaration\" than a funeral dirge or something (no offense).\r\nimprovements: ive listened to this a few times and i think i still feel the same, if youre going to maintain the music bed basically the whole time, then great, but i think if i were allowed to produce this, i would see if you can play a less minor-more major progression in the piano at the end, just to set another tone under \"is this really...\". either that or i would insist on some kind of break in here, otherwise its TOO emotionally draining and sad. im not sure you meant that.\r\n\r\ni give this an 8.5 out of 10, really really solid music, but really drastically different than his vocals\/lyrics and im not sure it comes across right.","account":"0"},
{"id":"12","song":"42","rating":"8","review":"holy speed demons. this is fast. and good so far. love the intro. listen to a little d+b but im not roni size. try changing up the distortion on the drums as the songs progresses, just move some sliders as its playing to animate it. great programming. i like how the guitar is now NOT a guitar, but a synth. love teh scratching at 1:00 and the guitar mangling. 1:15 hats need work, too static. GREAT programming on the fills though, and i love how all your beats are changing every 8 and 16 measures. are there vocals? i think by 2:00, you might drop a sub bass in there, maybe to the tune of the original bassline? just a thought. love the slowdown at 2:24. thats brilliant! drop vocals in there? please? even if its just a taste. love the scathing pissed off ness of 2:40 or so. also good. its not atonal. like the drop in of the beat and the machine gun style. put a tune in there somewhere and i think it would help. distortion on the kick at 3:40 is too crispy, maybe filter it a bit. i love the speed up by that part. oops. the ending just stops for no reason. youre a good enough programmer to put something in there, even if its a taper. shit. this is good and fast. perfect friday night driving late and getting lost mix. \r\nimprovements: a little bit \"without tone\" to the whole song, maybe thats intentional, dont know. love the drop down in speed, but you could emphasize it with a tune or melody i think and it would really stand out as \"this is the chorus!!\" and please more vocals? generally, i dont like remixes that are drastic departures from the original version without some tie in to the orig... but i like this one and will keep it for when i need a pick me up. \r\n","account":"0"},
{"id":"13","song":"36","rating":"7","review":"first, careful of the system noise youve got, theres a hiss running throughout--- maybe turn something down or at least noise gate it. thats my engineering comment. at the start, keep your own stuff in there, like ive said before, dont be afraid of showing off a little. ok, at 1:00, sorry, but it totally doesnt fit. i like that youve cut it in there and chopped it, but it completely goes against your interesting other parts that are in there. sorry, 1:52, if youre going to bring that in, buildup a little bit, put something else there for it to play against. it just seems chopped in without thought. again, the chorus and seconds before the chorus i think it would have more impact if it POW hit in there instead of the bring in of that. again at 3:09, wow, that really jumps out. it sounds like youre trying too hard to cram stuff in there. keep thinking to yourself, COHESIVE over and over and over. you have several good ideas, maybe do a couple versions? i like the filtery bassline youve put in there but make sure you compliment it with everything else. i could see 4 or 5 more original parts in there that you play in. keep working on it.","account":"0"},

{"id":"629","song":"1017","rating":"9","review":"Awesome remix.  The only gripe I have is that there\\'s parts where the strings drown out the vocals a little and I\\'d say it would sound even better if they were held back a little more.  ","account":"0"},
{"id":"630","song":"708","rating":"10","review":"This is one of the best NIN remixes I have ever heard. I wish Reznor would get off his ass and put out a CD with the best mixes... this deserves the recognition.\r\n\r\nRed rooM","account":"0"},
{"id":"15","song":"138","rating":"5","review":"intro is cool, finally someone changed the drums. good that you overdid the bassline with your own, careful about it, it kinda takes away from the melancholy nature of the tune, makes it slightly more \"happy\" for lack of a better word. i appreciate it though, and i also appreciate that you changed it up a bit as the remix goes on, so kudos on that. \r\ngood job on the pre-chorus too, same thing here. good work with the vocal processing. i notice that you dont change the given drums much, do that more, i like that you adjust it in the chorus like your intro, dont be afraid to put fills and things like the original song has. dont know if 2:30 is working with your synth parts, take a listen to that again. good flanging on his voice after that. you also do a good job of panning things around in the stereo field with things to keep it interesting. i can tell by now that this isnt going to stray too far from the original, which is good. i like the \"is this\" part at the end, thats good, keep working on the music for it. overall, good job. \r\nfor improvement, work on your synth lines a little. you do a good job of changing the sound, so maybe fade it in or out (its the same kind of texture the whole time) and maybe bring it down a tad in the mix, its pretty loud. \r\n","account":"0"},
{"id":"16","song":"78","rating":"9","review":"great intro, keep working on it, its nearly perfect! great drum programming and fills. see people this is how thats done! good use of vocal programming. also, the synth lines in there arent too atonal and fit with the music. with the delay at :43, you could let it ring for a bit. and i love that you changed the vox around a little with programming. thats good and not typical. LOVE the \"to hurt myself\" underneath. strangely, this simple little beat isnt getting tiresome, so good pick (or good programming i should say?) im not sure i like the noise that comes in (from the orig) at about 1:40, but ive heard like a thousand versions of these now. good chorus, but work on it some more. i like the drone underneath, but change its pitch to follow the melody and i think that would help. by the time \"the tiniest little dot\" you probably could change up the drums by putting another one underneath or something. careful at 3:00, that parts comes in and is too loud, so bring it down in the mix. 2nd chorus is ok, but again, change the underneath drone a little, it sits in the mix weird. i like the progression here, youve done a good job. i notice that you didnt keep effecting the vocals, so if you know this, fine, otherwise, keep doing it! like the delay on the drums at the end, keep it moving. for some reason, i think the ending (even without the drums) could be the chorus, so see whats different between them. \r\n","account":"0"},
{"id":"17","song":"2","rating":"9","review":"good intro. good drum filtering. great use of distortion. love the drum beat underneath, its just tiny enough. hey, doubletimed faster! thats pretty cool, and it doesnt sound programmed either which is good. be careful of your crashes, they are everywhere, maybe put them every 8 measures. i dont really care for the piano when it comes in, but thats because ive heard it. i think you should distort it a bit. when the chorus comes in at 2:10 or so its pretty cool, dont know if you repeated it too much. i like the guitaring you put in there afterwards. i love how much harder than the orig this is... im not sure if the now-sounds-like-they-are-rushed vocals are in the right place, but man do i love that doubletime beat. that kicks ass. you might want to try to put some fills in there (harder to program i know at doubletime). i love the break after the chorus. i think again maybe theres too many only's. this sure gets tough though when it kicks in again, thats fucking rad. wish there was something real no more---- this remix is real. only improvement i could add would be to grunge up the vocals (sound too nice against the dirty guitars) and chop up the vocals, consider taking out some of the ONLY's. ","account":"0"},
{"id":"18","song":"59","rating":"5","review":"intro is cool, because of the echo, maybe you could turn the feedback up and let it ring into the musical part of the intro. good reworking of the words, its kinda there, try to make these more seamless so that no one can tell that you didnt get outtakes from the orig. i like the distorted bassline, not sure how you did it. i also like the guitar chops that come in, thats good. dont know if thats original or from you, but good. the dance with the devil sample is ok, but i would manipulate it so that it doesnt get tiresome. i guess im a little worn out of the constant drum beat from the orig in there, see if you can chop it up or stretch it somehow (halve the speed and drop it under the main loop, or conversely, double the speed and put it over the main loop) or something to break it up a little. i wouldnt mind hearing that loop, since its the main riff of this remix, in a room reverb, as if it was a little further away. work on making and keeping it interesting ALL the way through, not just for awhile. i didnt get bored, but you didnt surprise me really. no offense. i think this one has promise, so keep pounding away. ","account":"0"},
{"id":"19","song":"92","rating":"8","review":"intro not that original, but i love when the piano comes in. i think its slightly off the tune, so play with that a little. i LOVE the part, just play with it, cant tell if its flat or short. the drums come in and WHAM, its good. gets its groove. yes, i can hear the vocal processing!. initially, i thought i was going to get tired of the drums, but i didnt. the chorus, man, the chorus. ah. the chorus. what to say? well, work on the piano part. you know i noticed that in this song, trents voice in this particular song doesnt have a pitch. maybe play with some slightly other notes. i dont know why, maybe im wrong. but dammit those drums are subtle and powerful at the same time. dont know how you did that, good job. at 3:04, im not sure that the piano fits anymore, i wouldnt mind seeing it slightly faded or bathed in reverb. i think if you process your sounds like you did with the drums, you would have a real winner. \r\n\r\noverall 8 out of 10","account":"0"},
{"id":"20","song":"55","rating":"5","review":"really good and deep intro. nice and dark. when the drums kick in at :45 they dont fit so they either need to be filtered heavily or buried in reverb like the original sound is. they just seem out of place. also this is a mixing comment but when the vocals come in the original reverb sound is too loud, so maybe bring that down. also, i think it needs to change during the song, it gets a little old after a couple minutes. i like the strings you put in there and the other noises, just the reverb-bang needs to stop\/start\/change somehow. i like the piano parts too. i like your chorus's and how you put ONLY over them. i think it fits nicely. like the ending too. record scratches. \r\n\r\nman, good remix, but change the reverbed parts and it would be near perfect. this is the perfect night song, driving on a highway in the back woods.","account":"0"},
{"id":"24","song":"65","rating":"8","review":"I like the 80s dance mix feel and it keeps with the funky feel of the original.  Very well done.  ","account":"0"},
{"id":"25","song":"75","rating":"8","review":"what i like best about this song is that it is a little bit of a mix of the early nin area and the original version of only. it has most pretty quiet parts but it also sounds rough enough to be not tired. most i like the mix of quiet and rough parts. they fit really good together. it is a song to dance to in the clubs i think.\r\n\r\nwheat i did not like that much is the last minute. i think the cut between these 2 styles is a little  too big. it does not fit together that well. this is the reason why i rated it as an 8 and not as a 9.\r\n\r\nalltogether this is a great remix of a great song.\r\n\r\nthank you Andre Cox for this good piece of music.","account":"0"},
{"id":"26","song":"65","rating":"9","review":"More upbeat than the original, but just enough to NOT get a {poppy} type feel, which is where I think a few of these remixes went wrong.  Drums + Lyrics = Good Job with this one.  I like what you did with them.\r\nI never give a 10 because nothing is perfect.  But 9 is as high as I go. ","account":"0"},
{"id":"27","song":"148","rating":"8","review":"I think this a cool approach.  I like how the drums are different, but I think the bass is a bit too loud.  If maybe that came down, then it would sound really good.  Oh, and I love the piano part in the middle, where everything else cuts out, but I wish that there was just a little bit more.  That was my favorite part and I was looking for it to go back to that again for the rest of the song, and it didn't.","account":"0"},
{"id":"28","song":"152","rating":"10","review":"A very nice reworking.\r\n\r\nLove the production, and the fact that the tune only uses a couple of the NIN samples - it stands up very well.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing more from the Zno camp.\r\n\r\n","account":"0"},
{"id":"29","song":"152","rating":"9","review":"\r\nAccoustic jangles and noise pave the way for funky bass and swooping synths. The vocal kicks in and is dub echcoed out of control in the breakdown lending the track an extra spacey angle. The guitar\/noises chug along in a groovesome fashion while psychadelic synths and static edged drum loops crescendo up to a full on industrial jam. Glitches give way to more swirling textured reverbed and bare distorted vocal overlayed with the original.","account":"0"},
{"id":"30","song":"152","rating":"8","review":"Forward:\r\n\r\nI would have to say this remix is near perfect. Being a very visual person, it was a pleasure listening and reviewing this remix, because it provided a detailed listening experience that made it very easy to visualize. To the average listener, it may just \"kick ass\", but to me, as an artist, I found myself imagining, visually, what the sounds were describing.\r\n\r\nThe begining of this remix starts out a lil choppy, and stale, almost giving the impression it was just gonna be another one of \"those\" remixes.  I felt almost like i could successfully predict what was to come, and nearly felt compelled to skip forward, or even to another remix, until around :17, where the layering begins to paint a scene. It does a nice job of allowing you time to adapt to the overall feel of the song to come. You kinda begin to groove with the distorted accents, and emerging layers. And then right at about :34 the drums kick in, and kick your ass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Visual Interpretation Referencing the sounds and emotions provided by the remix:\r\n\r\nSuddenly you find yourself immersed in a world of organised chaos, to the beat of what could be only be described as the intricate inner complications of the psych that Trent so clearly voices in this song.\r\n\r\nThe layers continue to build, drones swirling in and out, deeper layers begin to emerge, amongst the ever present beat of the drums, keeping thier time in this alternate reality. \r\n\r\nAround 1:07, the remix begins to take on a story like feel to it, taking you on the Zn0-Only adventure. Intensity of the layers now at full force, you hear the voice of Trent screaming in the depths, \"THERE IS NO YOU!\" almost trying to convince himself, harder and harder, before finally letting it take hold at 1:25, and riding with it, his voice echoing into the distance.\r\nAt about 1:43, you feel the emotion of reflection, rest, and coming to terms with the world that has surrounded him, repeating Only, over and over again, with the presence still very near to him, strumming away, and then blowing up again right in your face at around 2:01. He continues to fight it, his words still reverberating into the distance, the constant drum still beating away in the distortion, intensity and layers once again intesifying.\r\n\r\nFinally finding clarity once again, and bringing his voice into focus, THERE IS NO YOU! as if to say, seriously, F*** OFF! The layers subdueing themselves temporarily, avoiding his ill temper, but its long arms still batting away at him, stabbing, pushing. They finally fade, as if they have left, now only the time keeping drum pacing away, the bass seemingly supporting his cause. The moment he revisits the scab, and the doorway shutting, the layers once again begin to take hold.\r\n\r\nAt 3:17, the entire angle pans outside of the environment, you can imagine trents head pushing through a small hole, and in the silence, telling whoever, or whatever is on the outside, \"things aren't as pretty on the inside\", then slowly struggling, and being sucked into it all over again abruptly at 3:30. Now being thrashed around violently even tossed into the void for a brief moment at 3:38, as if toying with him.  3:58, gaining the confidence once again to fight it, screaming and kicking, while still being thrown around, to no avail  at 4:04 as he is abruptly silenced by the tentacles, pulling him down, no longer to be seen or heard, except for a few moments, getting a grip only for a split second to pry apart a space, only uttering Me-e.\r\nAfter fully subdueing him within itself at 4:12, it mocks his voice, almost smiling, \"only, only\" as if to say, \"ya right, keep telling yourself that. Fully engulfed and buried in a bloody thrashing distorted mess at 4:21, you feel him become a part of it, and can almost feel the emotion as the world now having fully absorbed his thoughts and energy, get scared at 4:31, hicupping, now repeating his words with a worried, troubled, unsecure, and vulnerable emotion.\r\n\r\n4:49 Now complete with its mission to make him a part of itself, and realising the now present consequence, the knowledge and emotion contained within, which makes it so insecure now, it begins shutting down, quickly deleting all the evidence of the incident, and its presence, shrinking away into the black abyss, never to return.\r\n\r\nWhen it finally ended. All i could think was, damn. It really wasn't pretty in there. It was so disturbing even itself was scared by it, and exited.\r\n\r\nWonderful remix, as it really changed the whole perspective, and didn't give you a happy ending. It was kinda like watching one of those movies that you just cant help but feel like, \"damn\", unsure of who you felt worse for in the story it told.\r\n\r\nHeh, hope you enjoy this visual while listening to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion and Overall Rating:\r\n\r\nAs far as an overall rating to this song, I chose an 8 only due a small but very important aspect. The begining which i noted, could really use more of a buiding transition towards the drumbeat. The instruments, which are just the simple source files rearranged, popping on sparatically and suddenly, up until :17 feel almost out of place until the other layers are added, just kinda put there as a temporary solution to segway into the bigger picture that would ensue thereafter. They dont possess the same smooth transitional layer adding the rest of the remix does. I feel that something quieter should be put here, similar to the wind at the begining of Hurt, something that kinda makes you wonder what its leading up to. Maybe even adding some of the echoed glitches from the end of the remix slowly fading in and out in the far background, as if something is approaching in the void, but you dont know what it is. In my opinion, this would make the introduction of the distorted loops at :17 seem more dramatic, appearing unannounced successfully, sparking further interest. The first 5 seconds of a remix can really determine how much further someone is going to listen to it. If you plop on what just sounds like the regular song files, interest can be lost very quickly, and what could have been a great listening experience gets overlooked.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of some clipping in the audio spectrum which can be easily adjusted, the intro was probably this remixes only major downfall, and cause for my rating. Altho small in the scheme of things, and the entirity of the song, this is probably one of the most potent \"make or break\" portions of a remix, of anything for that matter. You must hook the listener from the get go, hook them in, and spark thier interest, introducing itself as the remix it is, not just some rearranged version of the original.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear an updated version of this remix in the future, with a much more effective introduction, and wish the best of luck to the remixers in all future productions. Keep up the good work!","account":"0"},
{"id":"31","song":"47","rating":"9","review":"This remix is certainly different from most of the others here.  Many seem to go in the direction of trying to find a way to make the song more twisted or dark, trying to mix more grief or musical anguish into the song.  This one is different in that it takes the song, speeds up the beat and makes it more into a dance track.  Truely this is one mix that I could see being spun at a bar and indiscriminately getting people up dancing.  It definitely got me tapping my foot listening to it. The intro pulls out some parts of the original that you missed before, the middle is a bit predictable, but it peaks at about 2\/3 through with a fun climax, and finishes off cleanly.\r\n\r\nOf course there are some downsides to it though.  It seems like theres another level that this song could be reaching that it never quite hits.  The dancing side could be enhanced with a couple more beats here and there.  There are a couple spots where the timing on certain ques could be half a beat off.\r\n\r\nOverall this track will not win any awards for mastering skills or harmonic proficiency, but as an original take on the song with a dance friendly amibition this song soars.  Good job.","account":"0"},

{"id":"33","song":"142","rating":"7","review":"This is not a serious remix by far, and it is definitely something you should avoid if you're into remixes that make you say, \"wow, that was awesome.\" Strictly speaking, this remix did not have the effect that listening to Halo 16's \"Slipping Away\", or other brilliantly profound remixes had on me.\r\n\r\nThis remix, however, has a lot of charm. This mash up of The Hand That Feeds and the Ghostbusters theme song is very skillfully done. Nathan combines them very well. The two songs seem to merge very naturally, which, in a way, is kind of scary. Everything from the verses to the refrain sound perfectly natural. If I had never heard the two original songs, I'd still think it sounded pretty good.\r\n\r\nKnowing the reference though, I of course found the mash up totally hilarious. Anyone looking for a good laugh, this remix is for you. It's got to be the funniest NIN remix I've ever heard.","account":"0"},

{"id":"41","song":"143","rating":"9","review":"I liked the way this remix brought out the rock elements. The funk style of the song didn't do anything for me, I thought this remix brough out the hard edge anger that is expressed in the song. I especially like the drum track. It reminded me alot of PHM, The reason I rated it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I thought they could have done more with the song in some parts. Maybe used a bit more of their own instrumentation. Overall very good though.","account":"0"},
{"id":"42","song":"151","rating":"9","review":"This song has one of the most effective and atmospheric intros I have heard, which then breaks into a superb slow groove at 1:10. From here on the music progresses smoothly and simply, never trying too hard to impress or over use the samples. Letting the quality of the mix take control.  \r\n\r\nThe only criticism I could have is the use of “now I am somewhere” vocals at 2:30 – 3:00 which jump in a little uneasily (but not badly). Personally I find the lyrics of this song have been proving one of the hardest parts to successfully mix.

I would rate it at ten if it were not for one small detail, the lyrics, particularly early on and in the latter portion feel somewhat forced; they don't feel like they match up with the music at times.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, the music is spectacular. This mix is everything a good mix should be; different from the original. It makes you appreciate the song on a different level because you can appreciate it from a different musical genre.

This is a great club track.  It gives the best of both worlds.  Great to dance to if you were in a club (it has a very catchy groove), equally as nice to listen to sitting at home.  There is alot of energy in this tune despite it\\'s minimalism, and the arrangement is spot on. All sign\\'s of a good producer.  Last but not least, this track impressed me a great deal with it\\'s clever, and unexpected tempo changes, and suprise second drop (I wont spoil it for you, have a listen and see what I mean) both these aspects are very difficult to pull off successfully in a track and Slider has done it here with masterful ease.

Some of this stuff just sounds like garbled noise, relentlessly hammering away and after about a min, make me want to fall asleep, or worse, just dismiss it as crap.  There are so many mixes that go nowhere, do nothing, and sound like they were mixed by little kids.  Just plain sloppy!!!  \r\n\r\nWhat I like about this mix is that it follows some sort of pattern, just like the original track.  You have your build-up, and the beat change in the middle is cool.  I like the climax at the end and I think that it makes the song a true \\\"mix\\\" of the original.  The bass is different, the drums change, the climax is different, and I like the idea of Trent\\'s voice being distorted.  I think it adds an edgyness that the original just didn\\'t bring across.  Also, the distortion drops out when the beat changes in the middle, smart...good attention to detail, making the tone of the lyrics match the tone of the track.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think that this track really deserves a 10 compared to the others.

All the \"lo-fi\" elements like the acoustic guitar, mellotron flutes and wurly help mellow out the song which I like: i agree with the last comment that it has a taste of \"gorillaz\". LOVE the dub delay on the ends of certain vocal phrases. Wish you had more effects on the vocal overall to make it sit in the mix a bit better and to bring it further into the style. Harmonic content (chords, etc.) work surprisingly well with the melody. My only gripe about the whole thing in general is I would have liked if you had edited the vocal a bit more - the original track is phrased assymetrically (not in 4 or 8 bar form for eg) so it would have grooved better if you took out the breaks in the phrases to go with your musical sections.

All that stuff about seeing thru himself and \"made you up to hurt myself \" and \"nothing in your world really matters\" sounds kinda deep and questioning about what is real. Is God real?\r\nWhat I like about the ewun remix is the glitch, stutter and hardness of course, but most of all its the \"there's only you, there's only me,\" line. Kinda like the thing about how all the things we do here in this world are not really between us and other people, it's really between us and God.\r\nIn the remix I hear the same anger that is inside the original \"Only.\" Ewun's remix adds a dollop of hopefulness in the search for meaning, a dash of humor and finally serves up the thought that not all of us are lost or derailed in our addictions.

The snare sounds like an empty cardboard box that's being hit with a rolled up newspaper which doesn't help give the track much of a rhythmic backbone and as for the misquantized percussion, give me a break.  The chorus is where this mismix really excels at being both dirgelike, and sounds like an offcut from the 1st Ultraviolencec album which was rightfully kicked back in to the bin from whence it came.

{"id":"145","song":"313","rating":"10","review":"This remix incorporates and utilizes many key aspects of the song. It stays true to the original song with its \"catchy\" beat, yet maintains enough originality to uphold itself as a successful remix.  The song refuses to become redundant by sailing the listener on a roller coaster of various vibrations. The track starts off with a very unique intro and introduces the vocals with a very creative inversion of what sounds like breathing.  From there the listener is teased with the affective \"stop and go\" beat that teases enough to make the listener want more.  What I found to be most impressive [what I feel to be the true revealing of the talent in this remix] is when the first verse fades into the effects guitar which undergoes a smooth transition into the most soothing moment where a synth is utilized; here little acts for the most.  The next verse has more elements to increase the intensity of the vibrations and the pre chorus\/ chorus fulfill the climax.  What I found to be very clever was how in the second verse random sounds are intertwined and relayed, acting as accents to the vocals.  Although there is not a definite music scheme, I feel the random noises invoke a feeling of losing sanity; something I was felt trent was trying to relay based on the lyrics.  Trying not to ramble, the grand finale does not leaves the listener in awe as there is a compilation of vocal tracks played over a great sound.  After hearing this remix all I could do was listen to it again and yet again.","account":"0"},

Normally I don't bother to leave reviews, but after listening figured I should.  \r\n\r\nThis is OK. Probly his first time with any mixing software.

{"id":"151","song":"151","rating":"9","review":"This remix in all its essence, kicks ass.\r\n\r\nThe intro, which under normal circumstances, would seem too long, causing the listener to lose interest, does exactly the opposite. Its beautifully composed, with all the under and overtones, carressing your ears and preparing them for the grungy, swaying remix that is to ensue.\r\n\r\nAbout 1:13, you find yourself emmersed in some of the best parts the track has to offer, with the screaming guitars, and synths, with the ever present bassline, forcing you to fall into its groove. Trents vocals blended ever so softly, in the background, at times slowed, but never destroying the great feel of the song.\r\n\r\nAt around 2:23, it breaks. Up to 2:57 where it begins to flow back into the sway. In my opinion, I really could have used a larger build-up, and much more chaos building than is present. Hence the reason this remix gets a 9. After coming out of that sway, then breaking, I really felt the urge and need for a much more dramatic build. \r\n\r\nAwesome work.","account":"0"},

Overall a lot of your synths are nicely done, and the whole remix has a different and interesting sound to it. The phasings in the intro are well made, and sounds good, but on the larger scale your drums though nice sounding are a bit low in mix and a little boring, do more fills and turn up the BD would be my advice.

The BD youve put in occationoally in this part  is overpowering a bit, reminding me that this is an remix by a fan. also your drums seem to be a bit too much in R channel, again disturbing the balance. your verse works ok, although your synth seems slightly untigt and again a bit too mid freq. youve put a lot of nice synths in this piece, but you will need to work FAR more seriously with your EQ, to keep balance in the track, and keep single tracks from overpowering. youve succeded ok with just putting the vocals in there without doing anything to them, this usually annoys me in other remixes but works ok here. overall i also miss some basic structure, it seems that you got carried away in making lots of your nice synths and made a lot of single pieces, but forgot to tie them together in a fashion that reminds the listener that this is one whole song and not lots of different part that have the same sounding vocals. You could also have benefitted from introducing some more drum sounds, the basic thing about the drums youve spend time on is the BD, which is ok since this tends to be the carrier of the beat, but i miss some fills from HH and snare, and maybe some more diffenret sounds on HH and snare as well.

Also, at around 2:15 into the song you have maybe one too many effects going on. It sounds kinda garbled. Also your voice doesn\\'t sound as full as Trents. You can tell they were recorded at different times. I am not sure where you recorded the vocals at, but maybe at a more accoustical location next time with a little bit better production.\r\n\r\nOther than that I thought your remix was good.

The drumming is in the right place,   Usually, when I listen to a random song on the site, It starts off really good, then something crappy will be thrown in out of no where(like vocals that come from no where and unneccessary sound distortions) then it goes to hell, but this was not the case with this song.  When it came to quality, this song actually held up(very few are like this.)

I like that the listener gets comfortable with the repetitiveness of the lyrics and composition near the end (which fits with the lyrics of the song)only to have it abruptly cut off. \r\nThis artist really brings out the words in the song with his mix. The more upbeat tempo works well with the composition too.\r\nOverall, I think the artist who created this mix took a lot of time to compose and create a wonderful mix, that in a lot of ways I consider better than the original song (sorry, Trent).\r\n","account":"0"},

I like the hangeover around 2:58-9\r\nbut the one at 2:44 is a little too quick maybe have extended the intro a bit and it would have flowed better.\r\nThe cuts are great very rigid, the vocal effects were sensational, and the breakdowns into most of your leads were put together great.\r\nthe expression of the vocals were sound in they\\'re quality, it gave the effect of a real studio album.\r\nOverall I think its a great track that really keeps the feel of the album in mind. Its structured very well, and to be honest i particularly like it because it sounds liek its a completely origional track done as a remix of trents.  As in, most of the songs I have heard...Not all.. are really awsome, but I found most to be too short, or alot sounded alike, or even i found that most of the good ones i found were really wikked tracks but they used sounds or acctually in some cases remixed an older NIN track.  These sounded phenominal, but they arent \\\"Halo safe\\\" as you call it, and this one to me stood out because its very origional sounding, and its not trying to accomplish something that another has already done.\r\ngood track guys.\r\n","account":"0"},

I love those sections.\r\n\r\nHowever, the beginning feels glitchy and freeform in a way that doesn\\'t fit the instrumentation as well as the original song itself.  Hey, it\\'s okay to go with a NEW STYLE as long as you continue it all the way through.  The introduction just feels like you wrote that part one day and the rest of the remix another day.\r\n\r\nFinally, the main part of your track (verse 1 through final chorus) is so standard to the original that I wish you would have thrown a breakdown in there instead of the second verse or something along those lines.  The song is already long enough, so adding to it would be detrimental.  However, replacing something with a little creative use of the Only samples would be a great addition to your song, I think.","account":"0"},
{"id":"599","song":"1254","rating":"10","review":"The Sampling on this mix is really adding I like the explosion samples, used in tempo, with highlights of\r\nthe mix of drums, you can tell drums were retempoed pitched, added, and placed along with the original drums in a professional manner, the erotic samples in the begining are tell tale of the name of the mix adding a smooth almost night mix feel caused by the rolling lower pitches, the quality of the mix is great I can hear every aspect the artist wanted me to here when he wanted it heard making the work on the mastering phase aparent, I have used protools and other programs like cubasis this sounds like an acid mix giving more credit to the remix as a genuine article of original samples and many hours of equalizing and reviewing.

The rate of pace introducing new elements was GREAT!!  Laying was right on.  I was slightly disappointed at the beginning to the back half of the song as it seemed the remixer was just filling time with beats and not really trying to deliver the ear-candy that was anticipated.\r\n\r\nOne thing that stood out nicely was the end mastering.

He took the idea and ran a mile with it. (Try to see how many nin songs he sampled!)

Catchy, hummable, yet dark and leading.   \r\nLOVE the setup at 1:22.\r\nThe use of noise throughout the remix is a pleasant texture and a nice transitional tool.  \r\nThe drum sample is interesting as it is very dry.      \r\nYet again, Dirty Scarab has put his \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; little stamp on another gem.

This is just a cluster-f*** of distorted guitars, vocal samples, and piano chords that for some reason you tried to use as a drumloop...sorry that did NOT work.  Even with vocals given to us for a contest that can match to anything...you STILL could not match them.  And whats up with the random breakdown at 1:10?  That made no sense and had no direction at all. But nice try on bringing the song back at 2:49 and clustering a gazillion sounds into one.  When I thought it couldnt get any worse, you threw in the offbeat vocals at 3:35.  Im going to the store to get some Advil.  \r\n\r\nPlease take music lessons.\r\n\r\nJason ","account":"0"},

(Though I have not listened to it at high volume on a pro setup yet).\r\n\r\nGood mix, original (for a NIN song), not the stereotyped and typical \\&quot;I wish I could sound hard, distorted, and\/or twisted because my parents didn\\'t love me\\&quot;. \r\n\r\nThoughts:\r\n\r\nMaybe building a bit more tension in the first 30-50 sec or shortening the intro would be good. (Can you say\/express the same thing in less time?)\r\n\r\nGood sound, progression feels natural, though you start to loose me around 2:31-2:50. Something in there isn\\'t grabbing me like I know it could, I am not sure if it is the beat or what there is just a slight lull that makes me think the song is ending (maybe its my ADD). I think you were attempting to have the listener focus on the lyrics. As with NIN the words in my opinion play a more important role than the rhythm and I feel you were trying to keep it true to form.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nJust the type of track I am looking for.\r\nBy far the best I have heard on this site.\r\nKeep up the good work.","account":"0"},

Most of the Survivalism remixes I\\'ve heard on the site (with the except of the DefeatMixx) seem to be upping on the grunge or the glitch, or just a Drum&amp;Bass revision. Granted, I like D&amp;B, but only when done correctly.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a captivating mix. The piano plays PERFECT-- absolutely PERFECT-- with the vocals, and hands the song a different meaning. Originally, it was a fighting back song. Now it\\'s more of a display of what happens when you fight back in Year Zero. \r\n\r\nI feel a lot of pride, both swallowed and shown, in this song as well as regret. \r\n\r\nI give it a 9 out of 10, simply beacuse it really should be longer. Please consider making it a bit longer? Perhaps make the piano softer at the beginning, or have a nice fade out at the end to lengthen it a bit, maybe have a instrumental bit in there somewhere. \r\n\r\n--Less!","account":"0"},

{"id":"1209","song":"1700","rating":"10","review":"Great Work! This remix really stands out as an original take on the song. It has the tempo and structure of a punk rock song, but maintains the feel of the original so as not to mock it at all. My one critique, which for the most part you dealt with really well, would be that the increased speed on the vocal tempo makes the vocals sound unnaturally rushed at times. Not a big distraction though from a fantastic remix! Thanks! ","account":"0"},

{"id":"2502","song":"1776","rating":"3","review":"Speeding up the song can really bring out its underlying power, understated in the original.

You might say Throbbing Gristle or Skinny Puppy, and I would agree to a certain point, but there is only a \\&quot;tip of the hat\\&quot; in their direction.

For a ReMix I would wish myself a little more personal stamp of the creator. A little style of his own... the new cutted lyrics are good fun, but its not enough for a remix in my oppinion.

I didnt like the original songs chorus impact that much, so I tried to make oit more powerful. Also to me it didnt really sound like a chorus, so I used the \\&quot;dance\\&quot; part as kind of the new chorus instead. The structure of the remix is not a typical remix structure, its more like the song how I would have imagined it. The noise in the back is not perfectly mixed though and now already to me sounds disturbing sometimes, also with the mp3 data compression, the sizzling highs of the remix beat and also the deep bass are gone. It sounds heavy though with the wav-file I mixed. So this is a compression sacrifice. So maybe Sacrifice Remix would have a better choise. ;) Cheers all.","account":"0"},

However, my goal in this remix was to form a relatively heavy song into something beautiful and soft. As far as the music is concerned your right, it has little to do with the original song. Which was my exact intention. I actually wrote the music to this song with the MVH vocals in mind. So this music wouldnt have been created if i did otherwise.

{"id":"16915","song":"1230","rating":"8","review":"You know this composition has some very interesting perspectives to it\\'s musicality.\r\nThe creativity involved in the music arrangement is obvious but in my opinion hindered by the inclusion of  such very loaded subject matter.\r\nPerhaps the intention is to engeneer some level of discomfort for the listener.  It certainly did so for me and unfortunately will end up being the reason the piece doesn\\'t get additional play on my box.\r\nI am left with the feeling of wishing the lyrical content and theme were different because the musical composition is very good.\r\nBut that is my problem isn\\'t it.\r\nUnfortuneately there are not many places that I wuld not feel extremely self conscious about playing a song whose theme is so likely to offend.\r\nTHat having been said I hope the composer can find away to expose me to more of their unique musical arrangement without  the need to disturb me as much with the lyrics.\r\n","account":"0"},

The perspective is both fresh and innovative, at least to my ears. \r\nI am not exactly sure where this is gonna fit but I am sure it will make it\\'s way into my personal afternoon music set at least for the next few days. \r\nFinally the song does what very few can in my opinion. That is spark me to open up and begin work on another NIN remix. Trent Reznor mixed with Silent Narcotic make for a decent high I can recomend to all.\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n","account":"0"},

Not a very interesting journey.\r\n\r\nIt gets 6\/10 as a track because it lacks dynamics, and that's pretty important in a good track...\r\n\r\n10\/10 for the warm distortion though.\r\n\r\nWhat was used for the manifold distortions?\r\n\r\nIzotope's Trash is good, so is overloading a cheap pre-amp haha.\r\n\r\n","account":"0"},

It is, however, too simple I'm affraid...especially the first half. I found the drum line during the first and second chorus to be anti-climactic.

{"id":"28345","song":"1906","rating":"3","review":"I'm sorry that I wouldnt give you more points but i have some critcism on that &quot;remix&quot;.\r\nFor me a remix is more than aranging the original stuff a little in different order.\r\nAlso a great &quot;NO&quot; is to pitch the vocals down that much ...\r\nunless you want to archive a special effekt. And for that you should use it only on short passages and not the whole vocals. The pianotrack is well chosen, but your remix needs to long to catch the listener... try to shorten it or to build new elements in it.\r\n\r\nBest Regards \r\nTweakerRay","account":"0"},
{"id":"28346","song":"1897","rating":"3","review":"This remix is better than your other remix, though it is too short in my oppinion.\r\nAlso here is what i said on your other remix: don't pitch the vocals, it makes them sound strange. here you pitched it a little higher.\r\nand through the higher pitch it becomes also faster. To use the same beat only in a faster way makes this song to hectic... you could do better than that, arent you ? \r\nKeep it up !!\r\n\r\nBest Regards TweakerRay","account":"0"},

The changes, new layers, everything arrives on time, keeps the song moving.  and that breakdown after the half-way point is great.  i also like how you sent the long buzzing bass synth to alternating left or right stereo field.  i enjoyed this remix.  my one suggestion is something to reinforce the climax of the song with something, even as simple as white noise or a low-grade sample.  otherwise, good stuff indeed.","account":"0"},
{"id":"40718","song":"3053","rating":"4","review":"its like the art of noise took a stab at the beginning and let the rest of the song roll out.  granted the beginning catches your attention and the shift between spaces is great, but i sort of wish that when the song picked up again we would hear more of your contribution.  mixing certain elements louder is okay, and the noisey-siren breakdown is interesting, i just wish you contributed more to the sequence of layers.  towards the end you do, but your vocal samples appear to off time.\n\nnot a terrible go, i woulde just recommend taking your noise ideas to the extreme.  let them further infect the song and distinguish it from the original.  strange though befitting ending.","account":"0"},

I'm just here to tell you people a but about how I made this remix.\n\nAbout the &quot;not much done&quot; comment, the idea of this remix was to do the song as if I was doing it from the beginning. So everything you hear there has been ENTIRELY made by me except for the noises during the last chorus and, of course, Trent's singing. I've put a lot of work in making it sound almost as clear as the original, and add my touch in the mix.\n\nMax Lordom","account":"0"},

{"id":"54664","song":"3364","rating":"5","review":"Thanks for stopping by, and the good comments.\n(not being an ass here)Compression and EQ? How do I start? You have got to be running some kind of software to be remixing, right? Acid, GB, Logic, Cakewalk, Cuebase...something? I'm sure you know about plugins, search in google just type &quot;free VST&quot; and you should get links to tons of freebies, look for an EQ and Comp you like and download it, you may already have some in your own library? Compression, you can do this to individual tracks (maybe to get that BIG kick sound you want, or to keep things at a certain level, ...etc) but always you should really compress the entire mix. Multi-pressors compress a range than you control( kind of like an EQ mixed with it) the freq. EQ's there are tons of EQ's out there, find a really nice parametric and along with your normal channel EQ find another channel EQ with at least 24 freq channels. A limiter always helps as well on the overall mix, try to keep things at a constant level ( a rough job even for the pros). And if your not already you might think of running different tracks on different buses to an overall bus into your main output (I hope that wasn't too hard to understand...) \nA quick... lesson on Comps, really more of an thesis, Ratio plus Threshold equals Gain Reduction. (need more help on that?) There are lots of stuff online about sound mixing and producing, search for them, (a PDF or text files, something you can read up on and learn to play around with without being too hard to understand) they will have more info than I can type here.\nFor instance on this song (my thoughts, no slammin your stuff, O.K.) the vocals and music at the start could have been brought up to more to a fuller level, and the distorted drums are cool, but almost too loud it over rides the rest of the mix. A Comp can fix that, so you can still have the soft vocals and music you might want to start with but won't lose heavyness if you want to bring it on (if done right it keeps you from overloading your sound and keeps everything constant and full). I would also might think of investing in some nice power monitors, I know they are expensive but, they really give the full spectral range of what you are mixing, headphones are nice but they allow freq to be missing, overbalanced, distorted.. you get the idea. (THIS IS NOT A BRAG!) I just saved up and got some nice Tanoys self powered blue series, I think they are the best they were near 500 each though :( , but even Makie makes em for under 100 each, and lot's of other companys, When I listen to some of the stuff I've done on those monitors now...I wonder why I even put some of that crap out...ugghhh. (and you really need a pair if your doing stereo mixes, trust me you'll be amazed)\nI hope I've helped you out a little, hope to hear more tunes from you soon.","account":"0"},

I use a lot of different audio sofware, but when it comes down to it, I always go back to Logic for post work and native insturments (core bundle pack) for most of my main effects. I've just got Logic Pro 8, and some power monitors (which cost me...ummm my life, very expensive but worth every penny so far). I've found live drum samples have a different feel to my mixes, so my library is full of tons of drum samples from hand drums to electro and full kit stuff I've played.

{"id":"57573","song":"3353","rating":"9","review":"This remix is fan-fucking-tastic! A near perfect danceable mix to a personal favorite of mine from The Slip. My only gripe is the placement of the vocals in the chorus. The melody, rhythm and length of the chorus was kept true to the original, but the vocals have been shifted 1 measure toward the beginning of each line, and hearing it made me feel that it sounded terribly out of place. If there is any way the artist resonsible for this mix could just leave the vocals in the same placement that they were originally in, this would sound perfect, honestly. Whoever you are, you did a great job with the mix musically. If you'd just shift those vocals up to their original locations in the chorus, you'd be sitting on a masterpiece worthy of making it to the halo 28 cut. Bravo!","account":"0"},

{"id":"59746","song":"3648","rating":"10","review":"FYI - When I first heard 2Tom 182's song I thought it sounded excellent. Subsequently I asked for and received permission to remix a specific portion of the song after which I added my own vocal tracks, some synths, f\/x-machguns as well as some volume pans and other edits. In my opinion the credit for the sounds that are the strongest and sound the best should go to 2Tom 182 and TR. The other adds were done basically to suit myself and were not intended to either impress or appeal to others. Regardless, I do appreciate 2Tom 182 letting me experiment here and the feedback and constructive criticism. \n","account":"0"},

You asked so I wanted to give you my perspective. \nMy initial impression was that the sound is clean and the song has some strong areas but in all honesty I think you stay a too long in some areas. The beat you finished up on got my foot tapping. If you bring that up front, either as a layer addition or single track it would be a great to capture my attention right from the start. What you choose to do from there in terms of cycling and change ups if planned well will have me reaching to turn the volume up. \nThere is a lot here to work with.

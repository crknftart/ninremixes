damn man, quite an update! Love the warping in the vocals at the beginning. at :54, i cannot wait for whats next. amazing intro, maybe best ive heard. i dont mind the stuttering at all. its creatively used. good vocal processing, and you minimized it and didnt overdo it. good work there. the throbbing beat is good. by 2:25, its really getting going. love the roll into 3:00 and the first chorus. good work there. i can hear all sorts of things going on in the background still, thanks for keeping it. all sorts of layers here. into chorus 2, great work there too. piano is louder and necessary. i like the way you fit everything in, nothing is out of place or sticking out. so it looks like you spent awhile doing this and really knocked it dead. there are absolutely no parts of this that i get bored, or can guess what comes next. keeps me wanting more. watch out clubs, this is the killer re-remix!

            <column name="review">sefiros, only_recollection:
intro, good so far, nice tension and build up. not that every song has to have that, but its good that you put this in there. kick comes in and fits nicely, almost like a heartbeat (might want to intentionally make it a heartbeat by putting another kick a 16th note behind it?) pianos are good, they also fit. good so far. really good tension, then the beat kicks in. main vocals come in with guitars, still fits. well done there too. voice could have a little more reverb i think so that its in the same neighborhood as the rest of the instruments. does 2nd verse come in too quickly? not sure. good vocal editing there. by 3:25, im not sure that the music is going the same direction as the vocals. i like the music, but somehow not the vocals. slap back echo drums are a little too far back, might want to bring the wet/dry mix a little drier. good programming of drums though. by now im reminded that the main line hasnt stopped or broken. might consider some kind of break, pause, whatever in there between something like verse and verse or verse and chorus. not sure. this is definitely good music score material, so well done there. by 5:30, im really wishing for a break or something in the buzz thats going, and i think my ears want the &quot;searching, frustrated&quot; sound to lead to something new and fresh, not sure is.
is this really all there is is well placed, but the music is still the same. it seems like this would be the perfect point to change the melody to something else entirely? maybe thats just me. ok, now we have 16 repetitions of that, im not sure if thats a tad too many.
woah. at 7:48, this part of the mpeg really hoses winamp! good job on that! oh, you probably didnt mean that. might want to re-encode that.
hmmm. finally got to the ending. dont get me wrong, the music is GOOD, but im not sure that it needs to be that sad, especially at the end. i think of this song as more of a &quot;declaration&quot; than a funeral dirge or something (no offense).
improvements: ive listened to this a few times and i think i still feel the same, if youre going to maintain the music bed basically the whole time, then great, but i think if i were allowed to produce this, i would see if you can play a less minor-more major progression in the piano at the end, just to set another tone under &quot;is this really...&quot;. either that or i would insist on some kind of break in here, otherwise its TOO emotionally draining and sad. im not sure you meant that.

i give this an 8.5 out of 10, really really solid music, but really drastically different than his vocals/lyrics and im not sure it comes across right.</column>

            <column name="review">holy speed demons. this is fast. and good so far. love the intro. listen to a little d+b but im not roni size. try changing up the distortion on the drums as the songs progresses, just move some sliders as its playing to animate it. great programming. i like how the guitar is now NOT a guitar, but a synth. love teh scratching at 1:00 and the guitar mangling. 1:15 hats need work, too static. GREAT programming on the fills though, and i love how all your beats are changing every 8 and 16 measures. are there vocals? i think by 2:00, you might drop a sub bass in there, maybe to the tune of the original bassline? just a thought. love the slowdown at 2:24. thats brilliant! drop vocals in there? please? even if its just a taste. love the scathing pissed off ness of 2:40 or so. also good. its not atonal. like the drop in of the beat and the machine gun style. put a tune in there somewhere and i think it would help. distortion on the kick at 3:40 is too crispy, maybe filter it a bit. i love the speed up by that part. oops. the ending just stops for no reason. youre a good enough programmer to put something in there, even if its a taper. shit. this is good and fast. perfect friday night driving late and getting lost mix. 
improvements: a little bit &quot;without tone&quot; to the whole song, maybe thats intentional, dont know. love the drop down in speed, but you could emphasize it with a tune or melody i think and it would really stand out as &quot;this is the chorus!!&quot; and please more vocals? generally, i dont like remixes that are drastic departures from the original version without some tie in to the orig... but i like this one and will keep it for when i need a pick me up.

            <column name="review">first, careful of the system noise youve got, theres a hiss running throughout--- maybe turn something down or at least noise gate it. thats my engineering comment. at the start, keep your own stuff in there, like ive said before, dont be afraid of showing off a little. ok, at 1:00, sorry, but it totally doesnt fit. i like that youve cut it in there and chopped it, but it completely goes against your interesting other parts that are in there. sorry, 1:52, if youre going to bring that in, buildup a little bit, put something else there for it to play against. it just seems chopped in without thought. again, the chorus and seconds before the chorus i think it would have more impact if it POW hit in there instead of the bring in of that. again at 3:09, wow, that really jumps out. it sounds like youre trying too hard to cram stuff in there. keep thinking to yourself, COHESIVE over and over and over. you have several good ideas, maybe do a couple versions? i like the filtery bassline youve put in there but make sure you compliment it with everything else. i could see 4 or 5 more original parts in there that you play in. keep working on it.</column>

            <column name="review">intro is cool, finally someone changed the drums. good that you overdid the bassline with your own, careful about it, it kinda takes away from the melancholy nature of the tune, makes it slightly more &quot;happy&quot; for lack of a better word. i appreciate it though, and i also appreciate that you changed it up a bit as the remix goes on, so kudos on that. 
good job on the pre-chorus too, same thing here. good work with the vocal processing. i notice that you dont change the given drums much, do that more, i like that you adjust it in the chorus like your intro, dont be afraid to put fills and things like the original song has. dont know if 2:30 is working with your synth parts, take a listen to that again. good flanging on his voice after that. you also do a good job of panning things around in the stereo field with things to keep it interesting. i can tell by now that this isnt going to stray too far from the original, which is good. i like the &quot;is this&quot; part at the end, thats good, keep working on the music for it. overall, good job. 
for improvement, work on your synth lines a little. you do a good job of changing the sound, so maybe fade it in or out (its the same kind of texture the whole time) and maybe bring it down a tad in the mix, its pretty loud.

            <column name="review">great intro, keep working on it, its nearly perfect! great drum programming and fills. see people this is how thats done! good use of vocal programming. also, the synth lines in there arent too atonal and fit with the music. with the delay at :43, you could let it ring for a bit. and i love that you changed the vox around a little with programming. thats good and not typical. LOVE the &quot;to hurt myself&quot; underneath. strangely, this simple little beat isnt getting tiresome, so good pick (or good programming i should say?) im not sure i like the noise that comes in (from the orig) at about 1:40, but ive heard like a thousand versions of these now. good chorus, but work on it some more. i like the drone underneath, but change its pitch to follow the melody and i think that would help. by the time &quot;the tiniest little dot&quot; you probably could change up the drums by putting another one underneath or something. careful at 3:00, that parts comes in and is too loud, so bring it down in the mix. 2nd chorus is ok, but again, change the underneath drone a little, it sits in the mix weird. i like the progression here, youve done a good job. i notice that you didnt keep effecting the vocals, so if you know this, fine, otherwise, keep doing it! like the delay on the drums at the end, keep it moving. for some reason, i think the ending (even without the drums) could be the chorus, so see whats different between them.

            <column name="review">good intro. good drum filtering. great use of distortion. love the drum beat underneath, its just tiny enough. hey, doubletimed faster! thats pretty cool, and it doesnt sound programmed either which is good. be careful of your crashes, they are everywhere, maybe put them every 8 measures. i dont really care for the piano when it comes in, but thats because ive heard it. i think you should distort it a bit. when the chorus comes in at 2:10 or so its pretty cool, dont know if you repeated it too much. i like the guitaring you put in there afterwards. i love how much harder than the orig this is... im not sure if the now-sounds-like-they-are-rushed vocals are in the right place, but man do i love that doubletime beat. that kicks ass. you might want to try to put some fills in there (harder to program i know at doubletime). i love the break after the chorus. i think again maybe theres too many only&#039;s. this sure gets tough though when it kicks in again, thats fucking rad. wish there was something real no more---- this remix is real. only improvement i could add would be to grunge up the vocals (sound too nice against the dirty guitars) and chop up the vocals, consider taking out some of the ONLY&#039;s. </column>

            <column name="review">intro is cool, because of the echo, maybe you could turn the feedback up and let it ring into the musical part of the intro. good reworking of the words, its kinda there, try to make these more seamless so that no one can tell that you didnt get outtakes from the orig. i like the distorted bassline, not sure how you did it. i also like the guitar chops that come in, thats good. dont know if thats original or from you, but good. the dance with the devil sample is ok, but i would manipulate it so that it doesnt get tiresome. i guess im a little worn out of the constant drum beat from the orig in there, see if you can chop it up or stretch it somehow (halve the speed and drop it under the main loop, or conversely, double the speed and put it over the main loop) or something to break it up a little. i wouldnt mind hearing that loop, since its the main riff of this remix, in a room reverb, as if it was a little further away. work on making and keeping it interesting ALL the way through, not just for awhile. i didnt get bored, but you didnt surprise me really. no offense. i think this one has promise, so keep pounding away. </column>

            <column name="review">really good and deep intro. nice and dark. when the drums kick in at :45 they dont fit so they either need to be filtered heavily or buried in reverb like the original sound is. they just seem out of place. also this is a mixing comment but when the vocals come in the original reverb sound is too loud, so maybe bring that down. also, i think it needs to change during the song, it gets a little old after a couple minutes. i like the strings you put in there and the other noises, just the reverb-bang needs to stop/start/change somehow. i like the piano parts too. i like your chorus&#039;s and how you put ONLY over them. i think it fits nicely. like the ending too. record scratches. 

man, good remix, but change the reverbed parts and it would be near perfect. this is the perfect night song, driving on a highway in the back woods.</column>

            <column name="review">what i like best about this song is that it is a little bit of a mix of the early nin area and the original version of only. it has most pretty quiet parts but it also sounds rough enough to be not tired. most i like the mix of quiet and rough parts. they fit really good together. it is a song to dance to in the clubs i think.

wheat i did not like that much is the last minute. i think the cut between these 2 styles is a little  too big. it does not fit together that well. this is the reason why i rated it as an 8 and not as a 9.

alltogether this is a great remix of a great song.

            <column name="review">I think this a cool approach.  I like how the drums are different, but I think the bass is a bit too loud.  If maybe that came down, then it would sound really good.  Oh, and I love the piano part in the middle, where everything else cuts out, but I wish that there was just a little bit more.  That was my favorite part and I was looking for it to go back to that again for the rest of the song, and it didn&#039;t.</column>

Love the production, and the fact that the tune only uses a couple of the NIN samples - it stands up very well.

Look forward to hearing more from the Zno camp.

Accoustic jangles and noise pave the way for funky bass and swooping synths. The vocal kicks in and is dub echcoed out of control in the breakdown lending the track an extra spacey angle. The guitar/noises chug along in a groovesome fashion while psychadelic synths and static edged drum loops crescendo up to a full on industrial jam. Glitches give way to more swirling textured reverbed and bare distorted vocal overlayed with the original.</column>

            <column name="review">Forward:

I would have to say this remix is near perfect. Being a very visual person, it was a pleasure listening and reviewing this remix, because it provided a detailed listening experience that made it very easy to visualize. To the average listener, it may just &quot;kick ass&quot;, but to me, as an artist, I found myself imagining, visually, what the sounds were describing.

The begining of this remix starts out a lil choppy, and stale, almost giving the impression it was just gonna be another one of &quot;those&quot; remixes.  I felt almost like i could successfully predict what was to come, and nearly felt compelled to skip forward, or even to another remix, until around :17, where the layering begins to paint a scene. It does a nice job of allowing you time to adapt to the overall feel of the song to come. You kinda begin to groove with the distorted accents, and emerging layers. And then right at about :34 the drums kick in, and kick your ass.




A Visual Interpretation Referencing the sounds and emotions provided by the remix:

Suddenly you find yourself immersed in a world of organised chaos, to the beat of what could be only be described as the intricate inner complications of the psych that Trent so clearly voices in this song.

The layers continue to build, drones swirling in and out, deeper layers begin to emerge, amongst the ever present beat of the drums, keeping thier time in this alternate reality. 

Around 1:07, the remix begins to take on a story like feel to it, taking you on the Zn0-Only adventure. Intensity of the layers now at full force, you hear the voice of Trent screaming in the depths, &quot;THERE IS NO YOU!&quot; almost trying to convince himself, harder and harder, before finally letting it take hold at 1:25, and riding with it, his voice echoing into the distance.
At about 1:43, you feel the emotion of reflection, rest, and coming to terms with the world that has surrounded him, repeating Only, over and over again, with the presence still very near to him, strumming away, and then blowing up again right in your face at around 2:01. He continues to fight it, his words still reverberating into the distance, the constant drum still beating away in the distortion, intensity and layers once again intesifying.

Finally finding clarity once again, and bringing his voice into focus, THERE IS NO YOU! as if to say, seriously, F*** OFF! The layers subdueing themselves temporarily, avoiding his ill temper, but its long arms still batting away at him, stabbing, pushing. They finally fade, as if they have left, now only the time keeping drum pacing away, the bass seemingly supporting his cause. The moment he revisits the scab, and the doorway shutting, the layers once again begin to take hold.

At 3:17, the entire angle pans outside of the environment, you can imagine trents head pushing through a small hole, and in the silence, telling whoever, or whatever is on the outside, &quot;things aren&#039;t as pretty on the inside&quot;, then slowly struggling, and being sucked into it all over again abruptly at 3:30. Now being thrashed around violently even tossed into the void for a brief moment at 3:38, as if toying with him.  3:58, gaining the confidence once again to fight it, screaming and kicking, while still being thrown around, to no avail  at 4:04 as he is abruptly silenced by the tentacles, pulling him down, no longer to be seen or heard, except for a few moments, getting a grip only for a split second to pry apart a space, only uttering Me-e.
After fully subdueing him within itself at 4:12, it mocks his voice, almost smiling, &quot;only, only&quot; as if to say, &quot;ya right, keep telling yourself that. Fully engulfed and buried in a bloody thrashing distorted mess at 4:21, you feel him become a part of it, and can almost feel the emotion as the world now having fully absorbed his thoughts and energy, get scared at 4:31, hicupping, now repeating his words with a worried, troubled, unsecure, and vulnerable emotion.

4:49 Now complete with its mission to make him a part of itself, and realising the now present consequence, the knowledge and emotion contained within, which makes it so insecure now, it begins shutting down, quickly deleting all the evidence of the incident, and its presence, shrinking away into the black abyss, never to return.

When it finally ended. All i could think was, damn. It really wasn&#039;t pretty in there. It was so disturbing even itself was scared by it, and exited.

Wonderful remix, as it really changed the whole perspective, and didn&#039;t give you a happy ending. It was kinda like watching one of those movies that you just cant help but feel like, &quot;damn&quot;, unsure of who you felt worse for in the story it told.

Heh, hope you enjoy this visual while listening to it.




Conclusion and Overall Rating:

As far as an overall rating to this song, I chose an 8 only due a small but very important aspect. The begining which i noted, could really use more of a buiding transition towards the drumbeat. The instruments, which are just the simple source files rearranged, popping on sparatically and suddenly, up until :17 feel almost out of place until the other layers are added, just kinda put there as a temporary solution to segway into the bigger picture that would ensue thereafter. They dont possess the same smooth transitional layer adding the rest of the remix does. I feel that something quieter should be put here, similar to the wind at the begining of Hurt, something that kinda makes you wonder what its leading up to. Maybe even adding some of the echoed glitches from the end of the remix slowly fading in and out in the far background, as if something is approaching in the void, but you dont know what it is. In my opinion, this would make the introduction of the distorted loops at :17 seem more dramatic, appearing unannounced successfully, sparking further interest. The first 5 seconds of a remix can really determine how much further someone is going to listen to it. If you plop on what just sounds like the regular song files, interest can be lost very quickly, and what could have been a great listening experience gets overlooked.

With the exception of some clipping in the audio spectrum which can be easily adjusted, the intro was probably this remixes only major downfall, and cause for my rating. Altho small in the scheme of things, and the entirity of the song, this is probably one of the most potent &quot;make or break&quot; portions of a remix, of anything for that matter. You must hook the listener from the get go, hook them in, and spark thier interest, introducing itself as the remix it is, not just some rearranged version of the original.

I hope to hear an updated version of this remix in the future, with a much more effective introduction, and wish the best of luck to the remixers in all future productions. Keep up the good work!</column>

            <column name="review">This remix is certainly different from most of the others here.  Many seem to go in the direction of trying to find a way to make the song more twisted or dark, trying to mix more grief or musical anguish into the song.  This one is different in that it takes the song, speeds up the beat and makes it more into a dance track.  Truely this is one mix that I could see being spun at a bar and indiscriminately getting people up dancing.  It definitely got me tapping my foot listening to it. The intro pulls out some parts of the original that you missed before, the middle is a bit predictable, but it peaks at about 2/3 through with a fun climax, and finishes off cleanly.

Of course there are some downsides to it though.  It seems like theres another level that this song could be reaching that it never quite hits.  The dancing side could be enhanced with a couple more beats here and there.  There are a couple spots where the timing on certain ques could be half a beat off.

Overall this track will not win any awards for mastering skills or harmonic proficiency, but as an original take on the song with a dance friendly amibition this song soars.  Good job.</column>

            <column name="review">This is not a serious remix by far, and it is definitely something you should avoid if you&#039;re into remixes that make you say, &quot;wow, that was awesome.&quot; Strictly speaking, this remix did not have the effect that listening to Halo 16&#039;s &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, or other brilliantly profound remixes had on me.

This remix, however, has a lot of charm. This mash up of The Hand That Feeds and the Ghostbusters theme song is very skillfully done. Nathan combines them very well. The two songs seem to merge very naturally, which, in a way, is kind of scary. Everything from the verses to the refrain sound perfectly natural. If I had never heard the two original songs, I&#039;d still think it sounded pretty good.

Knowing the reference though, I of course found the mash up totally hilarious. Anyone looking for a good laugh, this remix is for you. It&#039;s got to be the funniest NIN remix I&#039;ve ever heard.</column>

            <column name="review">I like it, its got that old school NIN feel too it. Sounds like it could be something off Pretty Hate Machine. Do the vocals like up in the 2nd verse ?? Yea they do trent just sang both parts differently. The beat is good, very dancable, good tempo. I like the breaks and the way it end very much. Overall good job. I gave it an 8 because the overlapping vocals at the end seem a but muddy.</column>

The funk style of the song didn&#039;t do anything for me, I thought this remix brough out the hard edge anger that is expressed in the song. I especially like the drum track. It reminded me alot of PHM, The reason I rated it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I thought they could have done more with the song in some parts. Maybe used a bit more of their own instrumentation. Overall very good though.</column>

            <column name="review">This song has one of the most effective and atmospheric intros I have heard, which then breaks into a superb slow groove at 1:10. From here on the music progresses smoothly and simply, never trying too hard to impress or over use the samples. Letting the quality of the mix take control.  

The only criticism I could have is the use of “now I am somewhere” vocals at 2:30 – 3:00 which jump in a little uneasily (but not badly). Personally I find the lyrics of this song have been proving one of the hardest parts to successfully mix. Saying that, the use of quiet overlaid vocals under the music works very well throughout. 

Most importantly for me the mix stays true to the NIN style, creating a brooding and rhythmic wall of sound. Very impressive.

As a lyricis and vocalist it&#039;s tempting to begrudge the loss of some words, but when it has me bouncing my head at my computer (as hardly anything does), that&#039;s forgivable.
Grinding without being grating? Well done.
Hard without being harsh? Yeah, ok, well done.
Punk without the pretentiousness (is that a word?)...I know the lead-in says not to &quot;just say it&#039;s awesome&quot;, but sorry I&#039;m going to have to. Too busy enjoying it to think of more obscure adjectives.

Yeah, I started to get a little bored with the piece about two thirds of the way in, but that&#039;s just personal opinion.  I mean it&#039;s really niceley done, I like the buildups you entailed in this little remix.  Blended the original elements in very nicely.  Definitely better than some of the last couple of remixes I&#039;ve listened to.  Hey, if you get a chance check out my only, eight ounce remix.  It&#039;s under Sam Hillis.  Nicely done.</column>

Great Piano sounds at the ending. Keep up the good work !!! And take a look at my remixes too ;-D

Beyond this, the music is spectacular. This mix is everything a good mix should be; different from the original. It makes you appreciate the song on a different level because you can appreciate it from a different musical genre. In short, I think this mix is true to spirit of NIN&#039;s style moreso than many of the others.</column>

            <column name="review">There seems to be a growing trend for orchestral remixes for THTF, and I think the orchestral sounds lend themselves to the religious overtones of the lyrics.
This particular remix is faster (higher bpm\&#039;s) than the other orchestral ones I\&#039;ve downloaded so far.  The beat is stronger in this mix too.
The ending of this track has a more traditional NIN remix sound to it - ie distorted techno-esque beats and vocals.  It must have been difficult to manage, but it seems to work coming off the orchestral parts.</column>

            <column name="review">First off I would like to point out how impressed I am with the production on this track.  It is top notch.  I am very impressed.   This is a great club track.  It gives the best of both worlds.  Great to dance to if you were in a club (it has a very catchy groove), equally as nice to listen to sitting at home.  There is alot of energy in this tune despite it\&#039;s minimalism, and the arrangement is spot on. All sign\&#039;s of a good producer.  Last but not least, this track impressed me a great deal with it\&#039;s clever, and unexpected tempo changes, and suprise second drop (I wont spoil it for you, have a listen and see what I mean) both these aspects are very difficult to pull off successfully in a track and Slider has done it here with masterful ease.  Slider I salute you.  Fantastic track, excellent producer.  The only reason I never gave it a 10 is because I dont personally believe anything is perfect.  But if I did then I would give this a 10/10

CTRLer must be a great NIN fan... he has been able to add to his remix the sensibility of &quot;Hurt&quot; in the beginning and the anxiety of &quot;Mr Self Destruct&quot; at the end, together with a great production and best sound.
I have rated this remix with a &quot;9&quot; because the &quot;10&quot; is reserved only for Mr. Reznor ;-)

            <column name="review">I just about soiled myself during the chorus riff where Trent sings &quot;Only&quot; over and over. Very good, nice work on the percussion, giving a more industrial and yet ambient feel than the single. This is hardly a lazy remix, being both more sedate than the original during the verses and yet more energy-filled during the chorus.

Probably not the usual esoteric standards you&#039;d see on an official Halo remix release, which is a shame -- people deserve to hear this!</column>

            <column name="review">Finally, something I can relate to.  I\&#039;ve heard a lot of the mixes on this site, and I don\&#039;t get what everyone is raving about.  Some of this stuff just sounds like garbled noise, relentlessly hammering away and after about a min, make me want to fall asleep, or worse, just dismiss it as crap.  There are so many mixes that go nowhere, do nothing, and sound like they were mixed by little kids.  Just plain sloppy!!!  

What I like about this mix is that it follows some sort of pattern, just like the original track.  You have your build-up, and the beat change in the middle is cool.  I like the climax at the end and I think that it makes the song a true \&quot;mix\&quot; of the original.  The bass is different, the drums change, the climax is different, and I like the idea of Trent\&#039;s voice being distorted.  I think it adds an edgyness that the original just didn\&#039;t bring across.  Also, the distortion drops out when the beat changes in the middle, smart...good attention to detail, making the tone of the lyrics match the tone of the track.

Overall, I think that this track really deserves a 10 compared to the others.  </column>

  i\&#039;m thrilled that people even put effort into so much as peeing all over NIN\&#039;s work when presented with the opportunity.  but next time, don\&#039;t just tinkle.  work on inseminating some fuckin\&#039; spunk into the effort.  try harder, damnit!  this could be better.</column>

It is reinforced with quality everytime and is one of my definite favorites. It is catchy and very calm, then explosive at times. The lyrics are also laid out very nicely. Strong instruments and sound I might add, unlike others. I just can\&#039;t believe someone gave you a zero, what the fuck? How can they call this a joke?

            <column name="review">Definitely a Halo standard re-mix. An excellent use of drums hooked me from the start. The whole mix has a very strong driving force with a good manipulation of the samples. The only thing keeping it from a higher score is that it felt a little long in places and the odd change in pan at the end. Still a really enjoyable tune that I&#039;ll keep re-playing.

I especially like the restraint throughout the remix, esp. in the verses.  There was nothing needlessly &quot;over the top.&quot;  There was plenty of spaciousness in the verses for the vocal to build.  The banjo was a nice touch, too.  All in all, this remix sounds like a real *song*, not just a parody--very nice.  Call this incarnation Billy Bob Reznor with &quot;Nashville Nails,&quot; perhaps?</column>

that said, i gave this \&quot;remix\&quot; such a low rating because it\&#039;s essentially the same song you\&#039;d find on the WITH_TEETH album, but for a fuzzy intro and a matching outro.  i found very little going on here that impressed me.
  i also found the other reviews(nay, reviewers) to be misleading.  feel loved.</column>

            <column name="review">This is really a &quot;RE-MIX&quot;. There is all kinds of cool stuff happening with the acidised synth bass and the beats. Really nice. And the slowing down in the middle is a very refreshing and imaginitive bit. Especially the way the bass synth gets chopped up. Overall, a conceptually interesting and well executed mix. Booming! Nice beats and sounds. Nice work with the vocals. Lots of fun! Thanks. </column>

I love it when someone makes the tune their own and takes it to another place. Nice use of time-stretching going into the chorus. Did you do this in Ableton? Even though everything that happens in this mix is worth waiting for, some of the cooler elements should have been introduced earlier. Nice strings. </column>

            <column name="review">Great twist of mood. All the &quot;lo-fi&quot; elements like the acoustic guitar, mellotron flutes and wurly help mellow out the song which I like: i agree with the last comment that it has a taste of &quot;gorillaz&quot;. LOVE the dub delay on the ends of certain vocal phrases. Wish you had more effects on the vocal overall to make it sit in the mix a bit better and to bring it further into the style. Harmonic content (chords, etc.) work surprisingly well with the melody. My only gripe about the whole thing in general is I would have liked if you had edited the vocal a bit more - the original track is phrased assymetrically (not in 4 or 8 bar form for eg) so it would have grooved better if you took out the breaks in the phrases to go with your musical sections. Very interesting remix - got my attention!</column>

interesting combination of electro-style sounds with a kind of chemical/industrial beat, topped off with glitch noises.

top notch for sure!</column>

            <column name="review">What you think about the remix depends in part on what you think the original song is about. &quot;there is no you, there is only me,&quot; could be seen as a denial of the existence of God. Seems like Resnor&#039;s really mad at God to me. All that stuff about seeing thru himself and &quot;made you up to hurt myself &quot; and &quot;nothing in your world really matters&quot; sounds kinda deep and questioning about what is real. Is God real?
What I like about the ewun remix is the glitch, stutter and hardness of course, but most of all its the &quot;there&#039;s only you, there&#039;s only me,&quot; line. Kinda like the thing about how all the things we do here in this world are not really between us and other people, it&#039;s really between us and God.
In the remix I hear the same anger that is inside the original &quot;Only.&quot; Ewun&#039;s remix adds a dollop of hopefulness in the search for meaning, a dash of humor and finally serves up the thought that not all of us are lost or derailed in our addictions. Makes me want another plate of ewun &quot;with teeth&quot;.

            <column name="review">Sorry to say that i dont like this at all. What is going on with the mix down? Seems to me that all the frequencies are completely mismatched, the bass doesnt come in for ages and therefore completely misses the point of the track, for 3 minutes we have a sloppy beat driven groove that then breaks into the chorus which is totally muffled and the just sounds like a much much poorer version of the original, how exactly is that a remix?

Trent whines at the end &quot;is this really all there is?&quot; and i&#039;m afraid i have to agree with him.</column>

But I feel the piece really has no dynamics, it&#039;s just like a straight line to the end.  I was waiting for some really heavy drums to kick in or something groovy like that, maybe a buildup of some sort.  </column>

            <column name="review">It felt as though the song tended to be inlined towards the standard sub-standard tendency of remixes to default to &quot;dance&quot; versions. While this isn&#039;t in anyway a bad thing, I just felt that [With Teeth] was a complete departure from Trent&#039;s catalog background. In saying such, I&#039;d really like to see more remixes done with a much more organic feel. A good listen to Further Down The Spiral or Things Falling Apart is encouraged.</column>

If it wasn&#039;t for the bass being so dark and warm and blowing my speakers i would give it a 10.  But damn good nonetheless... Everyone reviewing and checking these out should listen to this one for sure.  I puts an interesting glitch, industrial spin on the original.  My pick thus far.

Zn0 altered it too much to make the song resemble anything remotely like trent&#039;s work. While listening to it, I almost literally thought it was another song entirely, rather than a remix.

The &quot;remix&quot;, if you call it that, is alright for amaeuers, but I&#039;m sure hardcore NIN fans would find it subpar.. it should Definitely not be ranked in the top 5. I gave it a 1 for effort, it would have been higher, but I didn&#039;t like the fact that the &quot;flow&quot; of the song was changed around so much, next time remember, &quot;sometimes less, is more&quot;</column>

            <column name="review">Great remix! It is ethereal and a tad darker than the original, and the exaggerated sibilance of Trent&#039;s voice is shiver-inducing. Still, even after the song&#039;s transformation, the integrity of the original has been preserved. Kudos to Blue Mobius!</column>

            <column name="review">I will have to give you a ten on this one. I would have to say this remix is near perfect. Being a very visual person, it was a pleasure to hear this remix. I liked what you did with Trent&#039;s song. Keep it up, you&#039;re sure to be one of my new favorite remixers. I can&#039;t wait to hear your next project. 
 
The beginning of this remix starts out a lil weird, but thankfully it gets much better as the song progresses until you&#039;re immersed in a sea of cleverly orchestrated symphony... the end kept me wanting more, I had to listen to it a few more times before even writing this review. It really is a good remix.</column>

You should make a slowed down chopped &amp; screwd version of this one .. It would be cool.... Overall this mix has direction and a good rythem...... The only thing I would change about it is some more effects on trents vocals and turn up the bass drum in the 80hz range about 3 db, or where it almost clips....Good job you have my VOTE...</column>

            <column name="review">mmm grunge, the sweet smell of that acolourful crud that gunes up many a sink.  this is what this fuzz laden failure of a remix stinks of.  Everything sounds so overdistorted that you can barely recognise or appreciate the original elements of that track that made it good in the first place.  The snare sounds like an empty cardboard box that&#039;s being hit with a rolled up newspaper which doesn&#039;t help give the track much of a rhythmic backbone and as for the misquantized percussion, give me a break.  The chorus is where this mismix really excels at being both dirgelike, and sounds like an offcut from the 1st Ultraviolencec album which was rightfully kicked back in to the bin from whence it came.  No amount of echoed pianos or attempts at atmosphere can save this badly told joke of an excuse for music.</column>

I&#039;m one for originality, after all, that is why Trent released the song for mixing to the general public - ORIGINALITY. Not the same old same old &quot;add something new and call it a remix&quot; thing. 
Don&#039;t listen to anyone that says you changed the song too much - it&#039;s originality that matters here.
In your remix, you took the one part that really mattered and hammered it into our heads to show what could be the depth of madness someone could really get into, to try and convince themselves of something. Like a frightened child repeating to themselves &quot;There is no monster, there is no monster&quot;, but with a lot more pure madness in a way, or hatred. </column>

What seperates this remix from others and makes this one stand out is the druming(it is natural and RAW, and is kick ass!).  -Makes my head bobble.  This song contains my favorite drumming of any song on here, and it just flows great, plus it goes well with the guitar.  Distortions are nice in trents voice.  You brits certainly are good with music, I will give that.  It isn\&#039;t cool though that you have reviews of jealous slander, but I see can through their simple words.</column>

 Well distributed distorsion were it\&#039;s required, by using digital effects. Obsessive riffs contrasted by the simply melody of the piano. The rithm section is never ostinato (like most other remixes).

            <column name="review">A very avantgarde take on Only. What\&#039;s appealing the most about this mix is how successfully it turns Only into a trance song. The extra samples used and the overall paranoid feel to the song makes it a good listen. My only complaint is the level of repetitiveness. A shorter mix may perhaps have been a better one. But this is not a severe disadvantage. Overall, the mix is high quality. Good job.</column>

            <column name="review">This remix incorporates and utilizes many key aspects of the song. It stays true to the original song with its &quot;catchy&quot; beat, yet maintains enough originality to uphold itself as a successful remix.  The song refuses to become redundant by sailing the listener on a roller coaster of various vibrations. The track starts off with a very unique intro and introduces the vocals with a very creative inversion of what sounds like breathing.  From there the listener is teased with the affective &quot;stop and go&quot; beat that teases enough to make the listener want more.  What I found to be most impressive [what I feel to be the true revealing of the talent in this remix] is when the first verse fades into the effects guitar which undergoes a smooth transition into the most soothing moment where a synth is utilized; here little acts for the most.  The next verse has more elements to increase the intensity of the vibrations and the pre chorus/ chorus fulfill the climax.  What I found to be very clever was how in the second verse random sounds are intertwined and relayed, acting as accents to the vocals.  Although there is not a definite music scheme, I feel the random noises invoke a feeling of losing sanity; something I was felt trent was trying to relay based on the lyrics.  Trying not to ramble, the grand finale does not leaves the listener in awe as there is a compilation of vocal tracks played over a great sound.  After hearing this remix all I could do was listen to it again and yet again.</column>

            <column name="review">I downloaded this thinking that since it had so many votes it would be a top notch, expecting a dramatic brilliant revisioning of this song.  As well, since every second review of it sang praises of it (coincidentally always after a bad review, and always left by a simple first name only) it should have been great.  Normally I don&#039;t bother to leave reviews, but after listening figured I should.  

This is OK. Probly his first time with any mixing software. It doesn&#039;t really go anywhere, but as a background music for a video game, where you&#039;re really not listening to it, but sorta are, it would do OK.  

I would give it a 6.5, but because I know the maker is going to submit another review of it to counter my review anyways, I need to lower mine enough to bring our average to the right point.  </column>

            <column name="review">This remix in all its essence, kicks ass.

The intro, which under normal circumstances, would seem too long, causing the listener to lose interest, does exactly the opposite. Its beautifully composed, with all the under and overtones, carressing your ears and preparing them for the grungy, swaying remix that is to ensue.

About 1:13, you find yourself emmersed in some of the best parts the track has to offer, with the screaming guitars, and synths, with the ever present bassline, forcing you to fall into its groove. Trents vocals blended ever so softly, in the background, at times slowed, but never destroying the great feel of the song.

At around 2:23, it breaks. Up to 2:57 where it begins to flow back into the sway. In my opinion, I really could have used a larger build-up, and much more chaos building than is present. Hence the reason this remix gets a 9. After coming out of that sway, then breaking, I really felt the urge and need for a much more dramatic build. 

Awesome work.</column>

I was saddly mistaken, there&#039;s no thrill, just frill. Its slow, boring, unimaginative, if you like cheesy videogame music, this remix is for you! As for me, I&#039;ll still to the original.

As a sidenote, I would like to eventually listen to everyone&#039;s remix, but having dial-up forces one to be more selective, hence why I looked for the top remixes... and probably why I was very disappointed in hearing this one. </column>

This sounds more like a generic everyday remix of some techno band, than an actual NIN related remix. Bland is one word that quickly comes to mind when listening to this remix. I appologise if this is the remixer&#039;s first attempt ever, if it is, then its pretty ok.. but as a hardcore NIN fan, it doesn&#039;t seem to do Trent the proper justice he deserves. I think it Could be much better if there were something totally off-the-wall that was thrown in there to kickstart the tempo into overdrive. </column>

            <column name="review">A fantastic remix of THTF with just the right mix of DnB, techno, piano, and stylistic flow fluctuations. Thre are a few flaws here and there, the most jarring being the slightly underwhelming opening; I\&#039;m particularly not fond of the whole \&quot;Jackles\&quot; line being spoken before the song begins. The song however develops quite nicely and is definitely worth multiple listens.</column>

            <column name="review">Compared with the others, this remix offers more in terms of enhancing the original rather than simply offering one or two changes throughout.  From the first chorus this song takes on a life of its own, without losing the artist&#039;s core emotion.  By the time you reach the end, you feel that you have been given a choice on how the song could be successful.</column>

Been a big fan of Reznor for quite a while now and i would think this would be right up his alley alot more appealing to the NIN fans than  the remixes done recently by the DFA and Photek. Great minimal industruial grinding sounds and quality programming. Keep up the great work Brian despite all the haters out there!</column>

            <column name="review">This is probably the best remix on this site.  It maintains a pwerful beat while adding new musical aspects into the song.  He changes the feel of the song rather than just chopping the song into a mess.  The introduction of a different but similar beat adds a lot of sophistication to the song.  Not to mention i can actually hear this song as a professional remix.  Nice job P Loco.</column>

It could be worse, but never a 10, not worth a 5, but maybe in the third try it\&#039;s great (better than first, but not enough). </column>

This mix tho, it sounds like it could be on an official remix album. it\&#039;s very rad. except, it could have ended at 4:08. it\&#039;s ruined at the end when it\&#039;s turned into drum &amp; bass, which just doesn\&#039;t fit with the rest of the mix.</column>

            <column name="review">Very impressive, I think this is the best remix so far, both how it\&#039;s been produced and how the tension builds up in the music. There are a lot of small details playing around in the background, there\&#039;s always something new going on, and yet it\&#039;s never over-done.
By the way, what does kAlte Fabren mean - something artsy (and German) I guess?? Personally I think this guy belongs to the NIN-clan - his work fits in perfectly. Did Trent hire this guy?

I heard the first part, and I\&#039;m like \&quot;....nooooo....\&quot;!  I put them on, adjust my volume, and I started cracking up.  I couldn\&#039;t help myself (and I\&#039;m at work listening to this!).  Awesome choice of material!</column>

I love what you did with the new guitar part, as well as changing the bass chords all around.  I also like how you made it have a cool groove to it as oppossed to some noisey crap that a lot of people keep putting on here.  Man, you should do some more stuff and just go all out.

I would love to hear anything else you have.  Any website or anything????  

Hit me back at pmbrodsk@oakland.edu

I would love to share some ideas with you about new tracks or anything.

Peace,

            <column name="review">  aaahh!  this suprised the hell outta me.  the first portion of the track isn\&#039;t terribly amazing, but for some tweaks in the vocal loops.  then the bass goes nuts when the chorus kicks in, and the vocals end up fluttering around, descending into a rather abrupt drum-and-bass kinda break.
  the track ends way too soon.  i was hoping for more shifts in style, as not all of the vocal loops were utilized, but i was still glad for what there was.  music is rareley this interesting.</column>

A lot of people try to add in new elements of their own, and their remix comes off like a watered down version of the original.

for those that don\&#039;t know what the letter S means, next to his remix, it means:

\&#039;S - Remix does not contain any additional material other than the source files provided by the official NIN website, and is therefore considered safe for inclusion on an official release or \&quot;Halo\&quot;.\&#039;</column>

            <column name="review">I like this remix. It sounds like something that Trent might have done himself. Unlike some of the other remixes that i listened to on this site, this song seems to have different beats. the creator changed up some of the main time-keeping beats, but kept the tempo the same; very hard to do correctly. Good job Mr.Lenhardt</column>

Inclusion of Piggies from The Beatles, truely awesome.  Love how the begining sounds like New Order\&#039;s \&quot;Blue Monday\&quot;, and there\&#039;s a part that sounds like the Eurythmics \&quot;Sweet Dreams\&quot;.</column>

            <column name="review">There\&#039;s some good stuff in here... I like the opening quite a bit with the funky beat and all. But as it goes on, and the lyrics begin to take form, the music and the lyrics sound like they\&#039;re played in a vacuum. Totally out of sync and it never really improves as the song goes on. Then, and this is really dropping your score, at about 1:48, there\&#039;s a glitch in your song, some kind of noise that got into there somehow. There\&#039;s another one at about 3:58. They sound like when a CD skips. Did you listen to this before you submitted it? The best parts of your song were the musical parts. This would have worked much better as an instrumental mix.</column>

            <column name="review">I really like the orchestration on this one. Guitars, pianos, and Reznor-esque sounds all mix together suprisingly, and make this an unpredictable but ulitmately satisfying listening. The beat is also consistent throughout and never misses a step.And the fact that Reznor\&#039;s voice is nicely accentuated and bolstered by the creativity of the mixing is what sets this one apart from other mixes that tend to get drowned out in their own over-use of sound. I would listen to this one like it were Trent\&#039;s.</column>

The song started out great and has a killer drumloop but then got reallllly cluttered to the point where i could hear basically nothing but feedback from all directions.  All in all this is 50 times better than most of the Only remixes on this site so i give you mad props.

It\&#039;s minimalistic and still manages to keep me listening to the end. Well mixed audio, good deep sounds and interesting drum samples. It delivers what I look for in a remix. Recognisable, while still altering the overall feel of the original. 

It just doesn\&#039;t get me above the trees or on my knees. It doesn\&#039;t sound like much time was spent re-thinking the song. In short: too easy.</column>

            <column name="review">In my opinion we are looking at a rather qualified attempt to capture the essence of the original tune whilst adding some more ambience and making the piece more interesting. In particular I think the vocal works a lot better in this version and in general does this remix honor the artist a lot in its industrial sound.
I have few negative comments other actually.
This rocks imo.</column>

            <column name="review">a bunch of you guys are really mislead. i am a yoga teacher and i know what i am talking about. after listening to this tune i simply define it as a modern mantra, very like the meditation sounds i use in my lessons. it has a very dense mood and many variations getting you hooked from the very moment. the sound design is put up wisely and the sitars come up mystic and take you into another dimension. i will use this tune in one of my next lessons and i like the combination of modern music with ancient instruments. from russia with love - kukushka.</column>

            <column name="review">the song is sinple and repetitive, 

but what it has made not give me him to 5 but a 1 they are delays used in the voice on minute 1:50 that have made bleed to my hatreds of awful which they were. 

the drums becomes unbearable to the 4:00 since loop is repeated and repeating during the 5 minutes of song. 

intro seems to me pathetic since to put that guitar single it is subject is to have little imagination. 

drums does not finish sounding badly but all the short while is too repetitive loop and but loop</column>

            <column name="review">Long time no listen to such a boring remix. A lack of vision and creativity leaves its mark through the whole song and made me wait and wait for the vocals. I think Doom Patrol remixed his own doom with the same drums from the original song and same repetitive samples throughout the mix. The synths in the beginning and some other distorted FX don\&#039;t rescue the impact this mix had on me. Seems to be hyped by the remixer himself. Just felt to write this because there are so many pro-votings in here. Here is my counter vote from an objective point of view. Man, put your energies into a better Remix than in self-reviews. You get an overall of 2.</column>

I really love how the second verse was basically a different song than the rest of the mix with the hard tribal drums coming back in for the outro.  Great work!</column>

            <column name="review">this is a great work. Even better than the original song (every remix here is better than the original song, which is the most obvious song that Trent Reznor made, eheheh!). Great rhytm and great opening. I\&#039;m a couple of position under Prodoss in the chart but I\&#039;m not afraid to say that his work is even better than mine. Trent should learn how to make a pop song! :) A little bit of something more (I don\&#039;t know what and how) and this one would become a great song itself.</column>

            <column name="review">This remix is one of the best I\&#039;ve heard in a while. What I like the most about it is its originality and use of instruments not found and not expected in the original. Maybe a lot of people complained that it wasn\&#039;t true to NIN or whatever, but I don\&#039;t agree. I think a remix should be an original take on a song, and this one certainly succeeds. I don\&#039;t listen to NIN remixes to hear the same style over and over again. Bravo.</column>

            <column name="review">To be completely honest with you, I think you should cut out most of the original lyrics of the song and lengthen your rap verse. The rap was the one thing that sets your remix apart from the others. Only seems like a good song to rap to, so instead of a short freestyle do the whole MC thing!</column>

I absolutely loved this remix since the first time I played it, I couldn\&#039;t stop repeating it over and over again. I love piano music and I love the upbeat feel to the song. The simplistic beat inserted into the song was nicely done. If this song were longer it would get a 10!</column>

            <column name="review">intro at first seemed to work ok - although some og your pitching of the vocals doesnt seem to hit proper notes being out of scale... it is obvious that you intended them to be a bit off key, but this could have been done way better. making the whole intro (and most of the song) in half tempo, got exited at first - but this is no excuse for not having some evolution in the track - the intro got me bored, with no significant change until 0.43 (where the bass enters) this is way to long to keep the listener on hold imo.
anyways you definitely have some good points, but again it seems to me throughout the song, that you  have been way too slacky in doing the vocals, not bothering to fine tune them in our pitching and the sequincing is not always tight. overall i like  your general idea of making this mix very \&quot;ugly\&quot;, and some of the drumwork around the ending is very nice.
ill rate i for around a 6, but give it 7 in a show of good will - hope you can use my comments - rock on =D

            <column name="review">interesting piece of work here.  i like the added beat to the song, however it\&#039;s a little too loud at points so it drowns out almost everything else, might want to consider taking it down just a hair, but just my opinion.  it works out great with the rest of the song though, other than there\&#039;s no real transition at 2m, just kind of jumps from one beat to the next.  i do like the vocals at about 2.15, probably my favorite part of the song.  i also really like the chorus, but again, the beat is a little too loud, so it kind of drowns everything out.  i also liked the tempo change at around 3:42, was definately a change over quite a few of the remixes i\&#039;ve heard.    overall, great job on the remix.

            <column name="review">nice working intro - it seems to me there is a slight flaw in some og the notes on the synth entering at 0.28, nice work on the vocals - i like what you did in messing with trents vocals, and you own addons works nice.
lots of extra synths working good, but again they tend to be a bit too ambient for my taste, overall i seriously miss some drum work, its first at around 2.23 (chorus / there is no u) that you do anything at all to the original beat.
the comes your own rap pice, which at times holds up ok - but seems a bit malplaced in mix, you could gain a lot from doing som EQ and panning on it. as for you abilities as a rapper, you could improve a bit as well flow seems unstable at times...
if you had put the same amount of work into the drums and rap as you did some of your synths you could get further.
all in all, i miss some sort of defined structure, and a bit more discipline in creating the overall soundpicture to make a coherent whole =)
but keep up the good work - ill give it 6,5 but round it up to a 7 =] goofy smiley agrees

I think the end could have had a stronger and more devined ending around 3:08 or a couple of measures after that.. So if you do a update on your remix please keep that in mind.... I honestly think if you do that update it could be on of the best remixes on here.. Its dark like you said and it keeps me moving with the beat..Its also new and fresh even though its a dance beat.Its not very often i find a dance beat in a quarter note bass drum pattern that i like..The reason for that is because its used all the fucking time...( but you pulled it off nicely )Your on to something....So Keep on keeping on brother !!!

Any other \&quot;Professional\&quot; remix out there either on a halo or not, simply cannot hold a candle to what you hae done with this song. I feel the meaning of \&quot;The hand that feeds\&quot; but i feel it\&#039;s being delivered in the tone of \&quot;Right where it belongs\&quot; which makes it tht much more meaningful. You should feel very proud of this remix, and anyone that has not listened to this or may think \&quot;I dont like remixes so im not going to download this\&quot; please do yourself a favor and listen to this remix NOW.

I\&#039;d say remove the dragged out beginning and it\&#039;s halo worthy at least for a single.

I like how its similar to the original in it\&#039;s layout, but suttle changes end up enriching it so much more.

And i must say, judging from what id read, i thought that this must be really cool. but i was sadly disappointed =(
first of all; you scarcely if not at all, have introduced any of your own sounds, which means all you did was rearrange NINs waves (here i will refer to \&quot;Opinionated Entry by Stiegore 09-24-05\&quot; in intellect), with a few effects..
secondly; your work with the waves is far too sloppy, i heard lots of clips, and if you cant copy-paste your drumloop tight, you loose me as a listener - sry =/

            <column name="review">This remix was well thought out and very distinct in style compared to other remixes on this fan site. It was as though Chris wanted to create a crescendo of emotion as the song progressed. I look forward to other remixes in the future. 

Also, I disagree on a fuctional level with the below review. This remix was anything but diffuse. It was neither to wordy or ill-organized. Rather, it was very succinct and organized with a seemly clear emotional objective.

            <column name="review">I must say, I like this remix even better than the original song!  The use of dual (echoed?) voices is very creative; I especially like the first instance (right around 0:23-29), in which the echo starts slowed down then matches up at the end.  I wish I had thought of that myself!  I feel this remix is very true to the feel of the original song, being less gritty and \&quot;noisy\&quot; than many of the other remixes I have heard.

I don\&#039;t really have much else to say, other than the fact that I keep this song in my NIN playlist and listen to it as if it were an original part of the \&quot;With Teeth\&quot; album!</column>

            <column name="review">you have skills as a programmer no doubt about that, the totally incoherent structure will draw your grade down, but that can wait for now.
the intro: c o o k i e m o n s t e r ??!!! did i hear that right?? *giggle* thats lame i like it!
well the first minute is only some og the original guitars with your own drums, which are ok - but not far interesting enough to keep the track alive and then...OMG
1.04 YOU start singing! and it works very nice actually - it takes guts to put your own vocals beside trent! im still missing some more instrumentation although at this point youve put some more stuff in there (ie some more ambient guitars). but then again theres something about the minimalistic approach that could work as well.
and then again at 1.41 it changes again the bridge reminds me og the avalances - which is great in my world as they are extremely nice programmers, and the drums following are max evil, and the again a bridge with cut up samples funny and good sounding! then another verse with trents lyrics and even though youve made some twists on the guitars this doesnt really do it for me. last verse (the tiniest little...) works nice, and the song ends well.

overall:
programming: you know what you do - and youre good at it, i really miss some more changes in drum sound, put a few more samples in there to keep them interesting.

Structure:
youll need to put the same part in there twice (most ppl choose the chorus) to give the feeling of a coherent whole, and tying the song together - you could easily have put the great chorus from 1.04 - 1.40 in somewhere again with a few changes, but the same basic sound - this would have made the song much more coherent and quialify it as a song, and note 5 seperate (nice) pieces.

Ill give it an 8 with extra thumbs up for programming and ideas.

            <column name="review">i really like what you did with the intro, sounds like some 70s sci-fi movie, but maybe 50 seconds is a bit too long with only a slow synth and distorted/timestreeched vocals. then in comes some really 80s drums, pounding 4ths working ok, but quickly getting annoying IMO, especailly as they are not quite catchy enough to be alone with a single synth and the vocals, the small varieties in the drums could have made this work better, but theres not nearly enough of them. Vocals are ok, straightforward, with a coupled of effects and cut-ups working to give this track a little more of the vitality it needs. then finally at 2.24 it gets interesting, you have put some nice evil cymbals in there, and now the drums work much better, maybe also because you used some more ambient synths putting some meat around the bone =)
the breakdown at 2.59 doesnt work though, the BD pounding 16-32ths doesnt do it alone even though its pitched at the end.
then at 3.29 this break works better and i LOVE what you did with the vocals in this part and this is well backed with lots of synths - then comes the chorus again (there is no u) and this again looses the feeling a bit, being far to scarce with sounds - i feel like this part really needs to pound my ears to work - overall - youre a really skilled programmer, but you need to remember that the listener is a little spoiled brat that needs to be entertained and keept awake =) ill give an 8

            <column name="review">This song is typical and lame, what can I say?  It starts off horrible and choppy, and worst of all, has no solid rhythm to it! All the song\&#039;s sound composes of pitiful, static-like sound files thrown together w/ no organization.  To make matters worst, Trent’s voice keeps popping in at completely unnecessary times.  This all makes this song completely uneasy to listen to.  Hell, I don’t have to explain how miserably crappy this song is because it speaks for itself. The \&quot;Opinionated Entry, by Stiegore 09/24/05\&quot; in the intellect section completely descirbes this song\&#039;s horror and its pitiful-unnecessary patterns, and basically the song\&#039;s whole self.  This song also horribly over uses that guitar(gtr cmel or something) sound throughout the whole song and it makes me wish I was deaf!  This song has no class at all and is an embarrassment to this site.  Also yet AsgerH, you talk down to me and my remix after you produced this crap??  Every song on this site, including mine, is far better than any remix you can ever muster up.  In final tought, you\&#039;ve obviously shown here that you have -no talent- buddy.</column>

You have managed to succesfully to put in beats that sound like an actual song.  The part where Trent says \&quot;is this really all there is?\&quot; and it\&#039;s drum beat is fucking awsome.  and dude, the drum solo after that , well, is pro!  Then at the end, that instrument that you use, I haven\&#039;t ever heard base like it.  I kinda wish the beggening was as good as the later parts, but I still JAM dude.  ROCK ON!!!</column>

            <column name="review">I have been impressed with several remixes Jahba has done and this one is for sure one of his better ones. The down tempo opening sets a dark suspenceful vibe. His drum programing suits the sampels used quite well during the drop. The tune maintains it\&#039;s dark suspencful feeling as the drums fluctuate with the guitar\&#039;s progression. Jahba\&#039;s use of drum editing and effects really set this tune off. The tempo is a little high for me, but it very tastfully done. Respect!</column>

entering with the vocals youve created some nice beats out of static noise, pretty good. after a minute though im getting pretty tired of the bass, its getting a bit monotonous. your drumwork continues and are through the song absolutely to notch, but overall i miss some instrumentation to give some relief from the bass. im a bit disappointed that you decided to put the vocals in there with no alterations, cutups or effects, they could have had a good interplay with you evil drums. youre a good programmer no doubt about that, should i recommend anything it would be to try your skills with some instruments to accompany your drumwork.

first of all i didnt know what to expect jungle vs NIN, def is a wicked combination but then i listened to the song and i could tell that its a nice produced song the beats go quiet ruff but and this is the most important thing its not just put an amen over the song jahba kept the feeling off the original song and made some nice ruff jungle tune of it (so for me its a wicked song ) the intro is just the correct lenght with some high energy that builds and builts and just when u start thinking man its long enough then it all breaks lose , high energy for shure this would rock a lot of parties for shure ,wicked,</column>

            <column name="review">i like how you start with the crackling sample, although i think you overdid it a bit with 13 seconds only in L channel, even as its faded in, and afterwards 12 secs more in bot channels, with one (when alone) pretty annoying sample. then at 0.26 some pretty nice drums enter, although i pretty quickly get boored with them as they are just copy-pasted with no changes. the little break works nice, and the BD coming in with the guitars are working good, giving it all a movie car-chase like feel. but all in all even though you have several good elements im now around 2.30 into the track and am seriously missing some elements to keep me interested, as far as i counted you have now maybe 5 or 6 waves on a total of 3 minutes most of which is copy pasted, this looses my attention. The only thing working well at this point is the breaks (ive counted maybe 2) hey wait - now at 3.20 maybe im starting to hear a synth you made yourself, it seems at points slightly out of tune, but works ok. suddently it all gets better and far more interesting this part is actually very nicely made yeah! BUT i would never have listened this far in the song if i hadnt been writing a review!!!
ill give it 7 since youre an ok programmmer but totally failed to keep me interested (had i not listened until the end i would have given you 4 or 5) you need to take care in every beat and make some subtle changes to please the listener and keep his attention - ROCK ON - AH of TheJigsawProject</column>

Anyways - first of all it refreshing to hear a mix that has made an almost entire redoing of all instruments, and made the carrying elements for yourself.
i must say that many of your voice samples (\&quot;rip like that\&quot; and portishead female) seem a bit malplaced, even though the girl from portishead (wish i could remember her name) fits good into your mix, soundwise some of the notes she sings are disharmonious with your synths. Overall a lot of your synths are nicely done, and the whole remix has a different and interesting sound to it. The phasings in the intro are well made, and sounds good, but on the larger scale your drums though nice sounding are a bit low in mix and a little boring, do more fills and turn up the BD would be my advice. I think youve put too many voice samples in there with no real justification - you have to remember that if you put something in there its because it really makes a difference and just MUST be there once youve heard it once.
Overall ill give you 8 for creativity and imagination but only 6 for craftmanship - giving you a total of 7 =) - Rock On - AH of TheJigsawProject</column>

            <column name="review">bass pads in intro working very well, good in sound and well phased, putting the vocal singing \&quot;only\&quot; on top work great as well.
then drums enter with the NIN bass sample, h and the cool bass disappears, and even thoug i like your drums they seem a bit too loud in mix, mainly due to them being very mid-hig freq, and the part looses a bit balance as there is now low spec to balance this. The BD youve put in occationoally in this part  is overpowering a bit, reminding me that this is an remix by a fan. also your drums seem to be a bit too much in R channel, again disturbing the balance. your verse works ok, although your synth seems slightly untigt and again a bit too mid freq. youve put a lot of nice synths in this piece, but you will need to work FAR more seriously with your EQ, to keep balance in the track, and keep single tracks from overpowering. youve succeded ok with just putting the vocals in there without doing anything to them, this usually annoys me in other remixes but works ok here. overall i also miss some basic structure, it seems that you got carried away in making lots of your nice synths and made a lot of single pieces, but forgot to tie them together in a fashion that reminds the listener that this is one whole song and not lots of different part that have the same sounding vocals. You could also have benefitted from introducing some more drum sounds, the basic thing about the drums youve spend time on is the BD, which is ok since this tends to be the carrier of the beat, but i miss some fills from HH and snare, and maybe some more diffenret sounds on HH and snare as well. But my main point will have to be GET FRIENDLY WITH YOUR EQs! This is the KEY part to making a proffesional sounding mix =) - ill give it a seven for all your nice synths - rock on - AH of TheJigsawProject</column>

My biggest problem with the remix was the part from 2:13 to 2:24 when the voice was inserted above the piano. It seemed during this time the tempo of the voice didn\&#039;t at all match the music.

Otherwise, I like the flow of the remix quite a bit. The use of foreign instruments was especially effective. A good listen.</column>

When the song picks up on around 2:20, it kick’s ass!  Variety can be found throughout the whole song, as you’ll notice new  beats constantly changing style, and it fits.  The organization of the drums, synths, and synthbass are good to listen to.  Oh yeah, I like the rap.</column>

            <column name="review">3:00--Either get rid of or syncopate those cymbal hits.  They\&#039;re way too metronomic (steady) and grounds the song at the end when it should be taking off and blowing up.

The beginning piano melody is too slow and morose for the vocals.

when the song kicks in ~2:30, that beat is phat.  it wouldn\&#039;t be bad to return to it later or perhaps use it earlier as well.

The song was lacking change so I will give you a fair 6 becouse there is alot of shitty remixes on here and at least yours was on beat and you put your own playing on it.there is very few perfect remixes on here,( I know mine is far from being perfect )
but still yours could have been better.....Keep your head up and keep on going man, It takes time to be great at any craft...I have been mixing since late 1998 and there is still more for me to learn..Peace

The intro and the near end to the song still needs some extra help, But over all I feel at least you did a hard and different thing and went for a pattern
changing arrangment in the mix,  mixing in anything but 4/4 is hard...So I gave you a 6....But I feel the mix could have been better
and there could have been more effects on trents vocals and synth...... but I have to give you credit for being a good editor and for being the only mix I have heard that is in a differnt count....</column>

            <column name="review">I agree with another reviewer that you should have changed the drums a little bit earlier. Also, at around 2:15 into the song you have maybe one too many effects going on. It sounds kinda garbled. Also your voice doesn\&#039;t sound as full as Trents. You can tell they were recorded at different times. I am not sure where you recorded the vocals at, but maybe at a more accoustical location next time with a little bit better production.

Other than that I thought your remix was good. I like the way you make Trent\&#039;s voice percussive at points so that instead of creating harmony it creates rhythm. Keep up the good work.</column>

I like the opening, sounds crunchy yet gracefull.+

Hmm...That opening vocal jumped out at me.-

\&quot;There is no you\&quot; bores me after a bit. It wants another layer. -

Cool floating pad sounds, and I like the synth bass.+

The groove here at about 1:30min is cool and melody variation makes me groove out. +

...Still quite entertained here at 3:00 min.+

good pads helping close this passage..with a kick ass break!!! ++ and smooth landing to follow.+

\&quot;The tiniest little dot\&quot; line at about 4:30min sounded too busy for me. (I wanted to hear you make a new little chopped up pattern or something, with his vox, that would go nice talking to a synth bass line etc.)-

Sounding good at 5+min. +

I could take or leave the orch hits. sometimes take sometimes leave =

Cool distort filtering on vox at about 6:20min and on. +

I could use the groove to start dissolving now, but that is my weak ears. -

Closing cycle is nice and \&#039;coasty\&#039; like. +

+ = 10
- = 4

            <column name="review">This remix is simply fucking awesome.  When I first came across through Limewire, I thought it was Trent\&#039;s, but now I know where this song came from.  I happen to have a taste of orchestras, and in this song, you pulled it off to a T.  The drumming is in the right place,   Usually, when I listen to a random song on the site, It starts off really good, then something crappy will be thrown in out of no where(like vocals that come from no where and unneccessary sound distortions) then it goes to hell, but this was not the case with this song.  When it came to quality, this song actually held up(very few are like this.)  This has probably got to be the most professional song on the site, though there is a lot of good stuff here, but this one sounds like an actual song.  Thanks for making a good tune I can relax to, and make more cus I like anything that\&#039;s NIN.</column>

            <column name="review">I really enjoyed this mix quite a bit. I especially like the way the artist highlighted aspects of the song that were lost in the original (e.g. - \&quot;losing my focus\&quot; is mixed in a way to put emphasis on the word \&quot;focus\&quot;  making it more powerful in the song).
I also like the abruptness of the ending. I like that the listener gets comfortable with the repetitiveness of the lyrics and composition near the end (which fits with the lyrics of the song)only to have it abruptly cut off. 
This artist really brings out the words in the song with his mix. The more upbeat tempo works well with the composition too.
Overall, I think the artist who created this mix took a lot of time to compose and create a wonderful mix, that in a lot of ways I consider better than the original song (sorry, Trent).

            <column name="review">Intro....waaay too long guys.

Interesting 303! Drums show little to no development throughout the track. Kick far too quiet in mix and drums generally pretty badly EQ\&#039;d. Some nice original bass ideas at 3.35 and 4.50 - could\&#039;ve made an awful lot more of these but hey...overall very, very repetitive and a shame given you\&#039;ve got some good ideas. Try concentrating on arrangement &amp; structure first, rather than production and overuse of delay, next time.</column>

            <column name="review">I think this is the Mix done b4 the Only Mix, which caught my att. from the 1rst 500. It\&#039;s a refreshingly good, honest experimental remix. Here Vargotah make NIN drift from spacerock noodling to a stoned-mystic atmo, generating a forlorn, ragged beauty in the process. This Mix seem to sit better alongside the band\&#039;s more exploratory tendencies: The closing is astonishingly lovely; a dense, immersive but ungraspable futurerock statement.</column>

ending was good. kinda left me wanting more. good tune</column>

            <column name="review">big jump at 43 sec. kinda lost the whole piano feel real quick. your  changes arent very seemless going into the verse. the see right through myself could have been chopped and blended a little better.good guitar chop at 2:35 . i cant see how the added voice overs fit with the rest of the song. could have used a bigger build up going into the vs at 3:30. the ending sounded a little unfinished . it sounded ok but with the title is was expecting much more.
good job.

            <column name="review">done very well, intro calmed, dark and crunchy. 

This remix remembers me to the sound of NIN in the 90.... 

the first shutdown with the single one of piano is tremendous, nobody to had vision to remove that piano to first plane like you. 

the following shutdown in minute 1:37 where you put the  sinth of nin, so and as this position remembers me  the  Prodigy or chemical brothers. 

as they are entering the guitars after of this shutdown is created great climax that concludes returning to the dark and sinister calm. 

I believe that this he is one of the best remixes .

This is an overall great listen, very well organized, and very original, yet very simple. Definitely an overlooked and underrated gem in our midst!</column>

            <column name="review">Musically, this remix wasn\&#039;t very innovative. It was your average club beat and so forth. This is, however, exactly what I think Idoliside (the author) was going for, and it is very effective. The part about this remix that shines though is the very effective use of lyrics, making the song a very good listen all throughout. Well done.</column>

Parts I enjoy best include the choruses, the guitar transition at 3:15, the way the bass guitar is, the drums, well..... and just about everything else. Some parts could have been just a little bit better, but Anywayz- good work remixing .

It keeps the reality of the new album  but trieds to superimpose the realities of the old.
Nice changeovers, good basslines if the stereo is good enough.  I like the hangeover around 2:58-9
but the one at 2:44 is a little too quick maybe have extended the intro a bit and it would have flowed better.
The cuts are great very rigid, the vocal effects were sensational, and the breakdowns into most of your leads were put together great.
the expression of the vocals were sound in they\&#039;re quality, it gave the effect of a real studio album.
Overall I think its a great track that really keeps the feel of the album in mind. Its structured very well, and to be honest i particularly like it because it sounds liek its a completely origional track done as a remix of trents.  As in, most of the songs I have heard...Not all.. are really awsome, but I found most to be too short, or alot sounded alike, or even i found that most of the good ones i found were really wikked tracks but they used sounds or acctually in some cases remixed an older NIN track.  These sounded phenominal, but they arent \&quot;Halo safe\&quot; as you call it, and this one to me stood out because its very origional sounding, and its not trying to accomplish something that another has already done.
good track guys.

            <column name="review">Excellent. There are very few good piano remixes of Only, and this is one of them. My only compliant is the tempo alteration done to Trent\&#039;s voice. Trent\&#039;s voice sounds unnatural in some places, especially when he sings words with \&quot;S\&quot; in them. This is, however, a small deficiency. It doesn\&#039;t ruin the mix at all. This is, in fact, one of the best remixes I\&#039;ve heard so far.</column>

Nice detiles in the mix and in the bigining the mix is riseing and maby it should be riseing insted of the beat droping down, maby a louder basskick or something to continue the rise in the bigining

I think it\&#039;s very NIN in it\&#039;s simplicity and mood, almost seems like something TR would have put together. I also think it\&#039;s cool that this guy seems to have built this from scratch, instead of just chopping and distorting the original, while keeping the continuity of the original. I listened to this with my headphones on and I really dig the spooky piano, subtle electronics woven through, the build-ups, guitarts. NICE!! I think Trent would dig this one! </column>

It builds up promising and holds a strong grip throughout the alterations. Made me very curious to listen on and on.

From what I can tell there is a guitar being played by the remixer throughout the whole thing, and at times it kicks in a lot more aggressively than the original. The mix isn\&#039;t perfect, I could use a little more snare drum, &amp; and a little more variation on the hi-hats, but all in all this is a damn good remix.

The piano drives the piece, but there are other layers -- distorted and not, that meld perfectly.  I think it\&#039;s a beautiful piece.

When I heard the remix I was amazed and the fact that it was different enough to bring a new life to it and has once again renewed my interest in the song. </column>

            <column name="review">wow this impresses me more than any other remix on this whole site!  I love how you tried something new and put the vocals on a different beat than the original, I think this works even better and has more rhythm than the original.  Great work if I could give it an 11 I would!!!!</column>

It\&#039;s actually put together well, the lyrics working to the music. It\&#039;s complete novelty, but fun none the less. 

I actually first heard it on a webpage, and had been looking for a version on MP3. Excellent!</column>

            <column name="review">I liked it alot.
the effects throughout the whole song added an outstanding... uh... \&quot;effect\&quot;
I started it out with an avg score ( 5 )

There were a few parts that could use tweaking eg.;
0:00the first few seconds felt to me like it needed another measure; -.5
0:28 the drums were out of sync -1
2:22 to 2:39 the extra high hat taps felt a little over the top -.5
3:12 to 3:17 the rapping there was cramped up and the flow was off -1
4:00 the timing off a little between music and drums (double kick drums in particular)- .5

before you think I just judged on negative points let me add this.

0:36 the sound effect there (falling copper disk?)
was a very good addition +.5
0:54 the \&quot;matrix\&quot; effect on trent\&#039;s voice in. wow.+1
1:11 the musical pause sets it up well for the instrument change+.5
1:32 again with the effects on the voice! awesome!+1
2:49 to 2:47 the transition put a good anticipation feel towards the rapping
and...+.5
The rapping was a kick in the teeth! I was not expecting that. It flowed with the theme of the song without biting it too much. Good job.+3
3:21 the tie in to the verse worked out really well.+.5
4:13 the doorway effect was funny.+.5
4:45 to 4:50 the high hat taps were right on the money here+1
5:15 the ending only wrapped it up nicely.+.5 for timing and .5 for ingenuity

If you were counting, it added up to 11 but 10 alas is the highest I can go unfortunately.

Good job S M!</column>

            <column name="review">This is like a more dirty version of only with a sound of Nu metal in the construction.
I like it because it don´t sound so cleanical as the more pop-sounding original version.
It´s nice that the pianos have been removed and replaced with very nice synthetic guitar sound that makes this remix to a killer.
The remix is not so much \&quot;electro\&quot; as typical remixes and in that way it can feel little special and also not much as typical remixes.

this is a recommended remix!

            <column name="review">“There is Only ME” is a great NiN remix that I can not stop listening on. It is not an ordinary remix in typical techno way with some kind of twisted sfx and upcuted vocals repeating and all other typical things that makes me unlike the idea of remix making. All this is missing in this remix. Yes I am not the typical person that likes remix idea because the remixes often are some kind of destroyed version of the original. But this version is great, It is one of is own kind and I even think it is all the better than the original. This sounds more raw and less pop compare to the original. The drums and the sound of the whole mix kicks ass!!… It is dirty and much distortion without to be too much. It is filled with the right form of attitude that I like… This is how I want NiN to sound…</column>

I can´t complain on the work that is complex and well arranged. But the sound could be better and whole song could have more aggressive attitude I think. All this tunnel effected feelings is also a negative thing I unlike with this remix. that things I like with this remix is the small noise part that gives my ears some positive feeling about this creation... But it is not enough to save this remix... </column>

It is a genuinely fresh take on the original song - bringing new, energetic sounds to the forefront without losing Trent Reznor\&#039;s emotional intention.  My favorite place for this mix is in my car, on an open road where I can let the layers of sounds and lyrics take full effect.  The song whirls into motion and then stops on a dime.  Thanks a lot, 9pod9!

            <column name="review">This is actually a mash-up of THTF with a song \&quot;Take Me Away\&quot; by the band State of Being. Many mash-ups tend to favor the vocals of one track, and the music of the other (i.e. \&quot;The Ghost that Feeds\&quot;). This one splits the duties fairly even, using elements of both songs throughout. Works very well on the dance floor.  (Note: The volume on it is a bit low, so turn it up!)

I love NIN and I actually like country quite a bit also.  You have managed to perfectly bastardize both.  I actually was going to give you a zero, but I thought it was so perfect in it\&#039;s hellishness that it should at least get some kind of score.</column>

There\&#039;s a good transition between the two. The overall remix is great. Kind of technoish without being annoying. Good stop and go sequences as well.</column>

In my opinion, better than than the original.
Solid, original and commercially viable dance music. The mix starts with fresh electric energy and follows through with out letting you down. If it didn\&#039;t grab your attention before -  5:19  in to the mix it recaptures the beauty of Reznor\&#039;s voice with a brilliant twist. Great use of effects and isolated vocals.
Besides it kind of made me feel as if there really wasn\&#039;t a \&quot;you, there is only me\&quot; - 
easy to get lost in the mix.</column>

            <column name="review">If there is one thing I like about this remix, it is the songs use of soundscape at parts that LACK the vox line.  There are parts in the remix (between the intro and the first verse and the outro specifically) that make me want to get up and dance to it.  I love those sections.

However, the beginning feels glitchy and freeform in a way that doesn\&#039;t fit the instrumentation as well as the original song itself.  Hey, it\&#039;s okay to go with a NEW STYLE as long as you continue it all the way through.  The introduction just feels like you wrote that part one day and the rest of the remix another day.

Finally, the main part of your track (verse 1 through final chorus) is so standard to the original that I wish you would have thrown a breakdown in there instead of the second verse or something along those lines.  The song is already long enough, so adding to it would be detrimental.  However, replacing something with a little creative use of the Only samples would be a great addition to your song, I think.</column>

the mix of drums, you can tell drums were retempoed pitched, added, and placed along with the original drums in a professional manner, the erotic samples in the begining are tell tale of the name of the mix adding a smooth almost night mix feel caused by the rolling lower pitches, the quality of the mix is great I can hear every aspect the artist wanted me to here when he wanted it heard making the work on the mastering phase aparent, I have used protools and other programs like cubasis this sounds like an acid mix giving more credit to the remix as a genuine article of original samples and many hours of equalizing and reviewing. I have also heard the original mix and by comparison there is just so much added, in key, and on tempo; I give it a ten.</column>

            <column name="review">Very well done remix.

The opening was slightly light on the opening pretension, but the rest of the work showed as the song developed in the first 60secs.  The rate of pace introducing new elements was GREAT!!  Laying was right on.  I was slightly disappointed at the beginning to the back half of the song as it seemed the remixer was just filling time with beats and not really trying to deliver the ear-candy that was anticipated.

One thing that stood out nicely was the end mastering. Whatever software you used to master did a nice job keeping it all in check and not squashing the mix into a homogenous pile of poo.

I\&#039;ll be adding this to my spin list.</column>

Starts off with a cryptic atmospheric melody n slowly progresses into a full-on tune, the guitar riffs make it all the more exciting as you listen further—the lyrics compliment the music and it’s a brilliant number for the dance floor!! In my opinion, very psychedelic yet sustains the gothic rock style of the band itself—

Played this track at a private gathering of close friends n even the ones sitting couldn’t resist n the dance floor was packed within seconds!! 

Excellent composition S-Cube!

Obviously he needed to grab the files from the internet but that\&#039;s where it stopped. He used his atari 2600 with amiga 1200 and sampled salt \&#039;n pepa &amp; \&quot;happiness in slavery\&quot; for christ\&#039;s sake! Most of the equipment is \&quot;pretty hate machine\&quot; era and for that move alone I need to applaud his work. I found this information on his old online profile. Hopefully someone has the exact write-up saved as I\&#039;d like to read it again. Very interesting.

One of the greatest NIN remixes out there. Far surpasses the expectations of a remix. He took the idea and ran a mile with it. (Try to see how many nin songs he sampled!) I hate to say it but I actually enjoy this better than the original due to the music sounding more like NIN than Trent did! I know that\&#039;s sacrelidge but it is true in many ways. The attitude is most definitely there and that\&#039;s what counts.

Also, I loooove the out of tune acoustic guitar being played over the space invaders march.

Seriously good shit.</column>

            <column name="review">While he did pulled off fairly good effects control and same solid sampling work, the mix lacked propper arrangement, sometimes bad flow between section transitions , overly predictable timing and of course the repeating of the one line of vocals got old after the first bar of its introduction. Possibly fixed by a much more indepth control over the repeating line in aim of adding that much needed variation while retaining the goal of it being somewhat of a building to a climax that never seemed to come when it was need.</column>

Once the song kicks in at 00:26 the energy levels never drop. It just keeps pumping till the very last second, getting stronger and stronger as it progresses.

The use of the Electric Guitar for the main riff adds a real “atmosphere” to this track. You can just imagine it being preformed by a live band, rather than a DJ spinning it on a couple of turntables.

It’s just Simply Amazing.</column>

            <column name="review">Think about the most twisted, obsessively manipulated noises known to man or machine and you still wont come close to the sounds conjured by Ephexis. When i heard this NIN remix by the one of the most exciting upcoming live acts on the rave scene \&#039;Ephexis\&#039; it really showed to me that they are true masters in what they do.

Fusing tough chunked up Psy influences, twisted psychedelic sonics and freeform together with hard rockin beats from NIN, the quality of this production is unsurpassed. I find it interesting to see such a unique collaboration of 2 totally different music genres. The rave scene versus the rock scene sure is something i love to hear.

I really felt that from 1:50 to 2:24 was a pure example of there technique to really bring a song to life! At that point i really became immersed into the music and that is what ephexis is all about, i love how they never allow you to become tired in the middle of a song, they leave no room to rest, there is no Breakdown!

It reminds me of \&#039;perfect drug\&#039; in the way it has an uplifting dance feel yet the toughness of NIN isn\&#039;t jeopardised at all. I can imagine this track having a real effect on a gig crowd!

I want to hear more!! hope these guys get the chance to take this further.</column>

I think even a better understanding of mixing/mastering could not lead this remix out of its misery: Too much plug-in treatment/too less creativity. The fact that it sounds like scooter on drugs and is quite monotonous doesn\&#039;t convince me to vote high for this. Heard too many similar sounding remixes here. There are quite a few mixes here that are worth a 10 but this one not.</column>

The beginning.LOVED how it transgressed from the Angry Sniper to to the song and so on.
The song integrating alot of the angry sniper into it\&#039;s theme and that was a very nice touch. 

Around 4:30 though was the only thing I had wrong with it. It seems like there should be more space in between the \&amp;quot;party girl wiretap\&amp;quot; and the next part of the actual song.

Other than that, nice job.Kick ass layout. Fun/eerie theme. 7 for you. :)

            <column name="review">I found this remix to be VERY VERY intereting and creative , although it doesn\&#039;t stray that far from the original , I must say that I actually like the arrangment BETTER than the original , and the vocal distortion and effects in certain parts and the heavier guitar towards the end makes this mix sound more abraisive and heavier than the original.
I like covers and remixes that maintain the integrity of the original song.
But , the aspect I liked MOST about this mix , is the part where the line \&quot;a tiny little dot caught my eye\&quot; was fused with \&quot;Down In It\&quot; ,( which has the same line) , and then fades back to \&quot;Only\&quot;. It is a PERFECTLY SEAMLESS and VERY VERY COOL idea to do with this song.
I have yet to hear ANY mix utilize the similarities between the two songs , and this one is PERFECT!!
I HIGHLY recommend listening to this mix , in my opinion , this mix is the best one the site.</column>

            <column name="review">This track/remix set to a house music beat is really amazing, it had me dancing and grooving all over the place. I like the way it builds and that noise at the end was very fullfilling. Great take on the original. keep stompin europium.</column>

            <column name="review">Spooky soundz, atmospheric nearly beatless blending. This version really presses the spectral nature of the song lyrics. With the original the fact that the song is from the perspective of a ghost speaking through a living man is somehow lost in the groovable beats. In this version the creepy chilled feeling of a ghost breathing right down your back calling out to find some sort of anchor to the world before they \&quot;fade away\&quot; is expertly illustrated.

Huge Kudos to the mixing team on this one.

Spread it around via word of mouth!

It includes elements of everything in the original, but arranged in a very nice way.
The whole track flows nicely, and keeps the feel of the original, though a little more driving.
Very nice work.</column>

just the way i like it ;D

anywho, i remember hearing this remix for the first time and telling myself \&amp;quot;Fuuuuck, this blows the original out the water into the dirt 6 feet below the ground and burieds it to never be seen or heard of again. 

Why? 

cuz\&#039; there\&#039;s no need for the original any longer. 

THIS is IT. 

This one by far supasses the original

. I know... i know... who am i to talk? but last i checked everyone is entitled to their own opinion... at least for the time being mwahahaha!

:O oh noez!! 

;D

so i was going to post the original write up (I archive a lot of dispyz related stuff just for kicks seeing as, if anyone is familiar, with the world known as \&amp;quot;Dispyz\&amp;quot; things magically disappear into thin air *hint-hint* ;) ), but it seems i have misplaced it or it\&#039;s on my other crappy computer... who knows! or perhaps it\&#039;s... it also has DISAPEARED! :O oh! noez!!!! 

HURRY! i\&#039;d download this if i were you!!! Befor it too disappears!!! :O

            <column name="review">Dirty Scarab loves little electronic blips and blops!  He invites the listener to question the integrity of his speakers. 
His chordal arrangement is stellar.  Catchy, hummable, yet dark and leading.   
LOVE the setup at 1:22.
The use of noise throughout the remix is a pleasant texture and a nice transitional tool.  
The drum sample is interesting as it is very dry.      
Yet again, Dirty Scarab has put his \&amp;quot;dirty\&amp;quot; little stamp on another gem.  Huzzah!</column>

Sick vocals! Sick remix!

            <column name="review">If there was a way to give you a rating of negative 1 million, I would.  This is just a cluster-f*** of distorted guitars, vocal samples, and piano chords that for some reason you tried to use as a drumloop...sorry that did NOT work.  Even with vocals given to us for a contest that can match to anything...you STILL could not match them.  And whats up with the random breakdown at 1:10?  That made no sense and had no direction at all. But nice try on bringing the song back at 2:49 and clustering a gazillion sounds into one.  When I thought it couldnt get any worse, you threw in the offbeat vocals at 3:35.  Im going to the store to get some Advil.  

Please take music lessons.

            <column name="review">nice version. the snare at the start was a little too harsh for me though (especially thru headphones), and i got a little bit lost rhythmically due to the fact that the vocals kept jumping around a lot. it was nice that you used very little of the source files and brought in your own sound. the structure was the thing that i had trouble with though. </column>

            <column name="review">wow this is really nice.

not a huge fan of the reverb on the vox, but other than that, this works real well. i really like the strings. the vox tended to drown out everything else though and the levels tend to max out on the choruses, but it\&#039;s nice to hear something different. well done mate :)</column>

            <column name="review">wow.. uhh i guess this was not at all what i was hoping for. i usually like piano put into songs but the original version of survivalism has so much energy that this remix seems entirely to bland. the creator seems to have missed the entire point behind the song by stripping it of much need electricity. also the end of the song in my opinion came to soon and was a little hard to listen to with all the noise that was chopped into it. it is in fact a nice attempt at completely revamping the song and making it his own however, there was definitely more that could have been done with it. it was a nice try.    </column>

            <column name="review">I decided to provide a real review as there are not many out there and it\&#039;s obvious this person put some work into this track.

Initial impressions:

Sound great! (Though I have not listened to it at high volume on a pro setup yet).

Good mix, original (for a NIN song), not the stereotyped and typical \&amp;quot;I wish I could sound hard, distorted, and/or twisted because my parents didn\&#039;t love me\&amp;quot;. 

Thoughts:

Maybe building a bit more tension in the first 30-50 sec or shortening the intro would be good. (Can you say/express the same thing in less time?)

Good sound, progression feels natural, though you start to loose me around 2:31-2:50. Something in there isn\&#039;t grabbing me like I know it could, I am not sure if it is the beat or what there is just a slight lull that makes me think the song is ending (maybe its my ADD). I think you were attempting to have the listener focus on the lyrics. As with NIN the words in my opinion play a more important role than the rhythm and I feel you were trying to keep it true to form.

Summary:

Just the type of track I am looking for.
By far the best I have heard on this site.
Keep up the good work.</column>

And this one changed up some .. So high five ...LOL ... I liked the synths alot .&amp;amp;gt;very creative .. I would have like some more effects on Trents vocals after the kewl intro vocoder  ...But its a real good beat .. You get a 9 ..</column>

            <column name="review">Wow. Just... wow. This is a very well done rendition of the song. Most of the Survivalism remixes I\&#039;ve heard on the site (with the except of the DefeatMixx) seem to be upping on the grunge or the glitch, or just a Drum&amp;amp;Bass revision. Granted, I like D&amp;amp;B, but only when done correctly.

Anyway, this is a captivating mix. The piano plays PERFECT-- absolutely PERFECT-- with the vocals, and hands the song a different meaning. Originally, it was a fighting back song. Now it\&#039;s more of a display of what happens when you fight back in Year Zero. 

I feel a lot of pride, both swallowed and shown, in this song as well as regret. 

I give it a 9 out of 10, simply beacuse it really should be longer. Please consider making it a bit longer? Perhaps make the piano softer at the beginning, or have a nice fade out at the end to lengthen it a bit, maybe have a instrumental bit in there somewhere.

This guy got it right!
Would like to hear more. 
Those beats sound different but the contrived timing works so well with the vocals to this song.
The guitar...or whatever that is.... the way the frenzy escalates plays off the vocals well.
Kinda song I want to crank up the volume too.
The ending could have been better and seemed unfinished. The reference to ann matao or whatever that is ...what or who is that?
Get this guy a beer and sometime and this mix fixes up real nice.

very sexy...

My only critique would be: 1) near the beginning it intentionally \&#039;skips\&#039; twice...not sure I like that...sounds too much like my \&#039;cd\&#039; is skippingin my car &amp;amp; then I start hitting my stereo...dangerous! ;)
2) @ the centre of the song there are some beats about a millisecond out of time.
3) Needs to be as loud as the original

I would love to hear more of your stuff &amp;amp; I\&#039;m definitely throwing this on one of my cd mixes for the boom-boom! ;) 

Cheerio~!

You always make the best mixes.  If a 7 out of ten is the kind of review you get for a masterpiece, and laughable response about heart, dont bother posting them on here...that\&#039;s rediculous.  It par for the course online though.

            <column name="review">As in, the USBM? Interesting.

I like the subtleness, the chorus definitely sounds MUCH better. And some of the ambient instrumentation is shiver-inducing. 

On the other hand, the repetativeness of the instrumentation in the background during the verses kind of annoys me a bit-- slightly remniscent of one of the songs from Fight Club.

Ending is a bit weak, but otherwise a mildy entertaining mix. Good job.

            <column name="review">Its ok,  like the dark element, especially the piano is great, but in  the end I think theres something missing, its sound like too few elements or tracks,  and sometimes the vocals dont reall fit the music. but anyhow, my respect for this mix, the best i listened to so far.</column>

            <column name="review">to be honest this is one of the best remixes i heard so far but its not over the top. sorry. the structure is alright, even impressive sometimes but then again nothing new to the original song. The verse always sound offbeat and somewhat weak to me, but helps the impact of the chorus to bloom up in full, ok. really good work here, but besides the chorus its not really outstanding. Nevermind. Give it a 7/10. </column>

this was my first attempt at remixing. i am sure there are mistakes. I used the song file provided from the bands website. mp3 trimmer., and apple garageband.

            <column name="review">Excellent in your face remix, brilliantly put together. I especially like the fact that it\&#039;s a million miles from the original track. I seems the only things that have remained are the vocals, and even those have been totally re-arranged. Also, the ending is a killer ;)</column>

            <column name="review">Great Work! This remix really stands out as an original take on the song. It has the tempo and structure of a punk rock song, but maintains the feel of the original so as not to mock it at all. My one critique, which for the most part you dealt with really well, would be that the increased speed on the vocal tempo makes the vocals sound unnaturally rushed at times. Not a big distraction though from a fantastic remix! Thanks! </column>

            <column name="review">This is a more polished mix of the original contraption version (Which was still pretty damn good). I love the spirit of this mix, although it doesn\&#039;t sonically deviate a great deal from the  tempo or feel of the original, it does notch up the hard beats and incredibly dancey rhythms. The end result is an seriously electronic, pounding dance version of Survivalism still full of edge and packed with energy. Kudos to Contraption!</column>

But the ideas here in the remix are great ! (glitch, doubled vocals,new spheric synths...and also the piano is a cool thing... some times the piano doesn\&#039;t harmonise with the vocals for my ear... 
overall solid production ! Check my versions too please...every feedback is welcome

            <column name="review">Speeding up the song can really bring out its underlying power, understated in the original. But overdoing it, without re-engineering the song structure can make it trite and forgettable. This version really straddles that line, and may be going over it completely. Even so, I would have rated the cut higher if the producer hadn\&#039;t had the volume up too high during mastering, leading to way too much distortion. </column>

  Waaaaay better than anything on here. I have no idea why this song has only 2 stars. Way to take this song and make it your own, not just putting a techno-beat behind the vocal track. Adding the guitars was awesome, cool breakdowns, and an awesome take on the piece as a whole. NIICE!</column>

The transition to the chorus is a little too jarring, though. The entire Cool feeling goes out the window.

Especially if I have listened to the other crap masquerading as music first. 
First when I came on here I wanted to give a review but continued to be stunned at the juvenile pop beats and ill timed side effects.
About three or four versions a day is all I could get through but I knew when I heard the auto erotic syndrome poster boy Reb saying \&amp;quot;it\&#039;s ok to be different as long as it sounds good\&amp;quot; and comparing this mix or remix or whatever it is to a \&amp;quot;hoakie red neck hoedown\&amp;quot; that I was about to finally hear a decent tune.
Good ole rockin roll is what it sounds like on my speakers. Decent attention to detail too and I am turning it up now.
First time nobody\&#039;s looked at me like what little kid made that one.
Anyways I hope I sound like a groupie and not the neighbor girl.
You know the one G!  Two door down and on the right.

Great stuff! I like that piece pretty much. A bit more variation will totally silence all those critics! ;-)

Keep it up! I can\&#039;t wait for the next tracks. Probably \&amp;quot;God Given\&amp;quot; would be perfect for a work-over.

As mentioned before, some of the vocal work is rough around the edges.  Perhaps you tried it while working on it, but some of the lines in the song that are spoken more than sung, I would think those wouldn\&#039;t have to be slowed down to fit the speed.  Some of the whispering, etc.

Kudos!!</column>

This remix is the only one you\&#039;ll need people, put it on your mp3\&#039;s and listen again and again!  With trents vocals and the fine trademark piano at the end, it all works beautifully.</column>

            <column name="review">Yes another interesting composition of Survivalism by Gary Lester.
What I like most about the song is the use of the mandolin. A choice that works surprisingly well. Despite the use of many different beats and instruments the song has the Nine Inch Nail feel to it.
I\&#039;ve  noticed that this and other songs remixed by the same guy  play almost like chapters to a book.
The vocal rearrangment is also a highlight worth noting.
Good remix.

When the vocals kick in around 3:00 needed more synths, get rid of the whole there is no repeat thing, doesnt sound good...make the vocals a little quite...it really gets off beat as well, but i can hear what u where trying to do....</column>

            <column name="review">I can\&#039;t help but make comparrisons to Stockhausen\&#039;s Hymnen, with the way the background is handled: the long seemingly single pulse, ever rising in timbre, building the tension of the piece to a rightful screaming crescendo. You might say Throbbing Gristle or Skinny Puppy, and I would agree to a certain point, but there is only a \&amp;quot;tip of the hat\&amp;quot; in their direction. The composition holds an original feel to it, that transcends what you might expect from a NIN remix project. This is an effort on a grand scale and should not be missed by experimental or industrial music fans.</column>

So instead, I decided to play with the song\&#039;s structure and rhythm.  I upped the tempo to 130 bpm and took out the bridge, replacing it with a synth layered bridge instead. This is just my first draft of what I want to do with it.  And of course, itâ€™s just for fun.  Hope that you listen to it with an open mind and enjoy it!</column>

sorry to be harsh, but all you did was build the track to it\&#039;s original shape and then add truly god-awful vocals to it (I hate to be blunt, but they\&#039;re pretty bad). I just did not see the point in this at all.</column>

I hope Trent Reznor likes it as much as I do!!!!!!!!!!

Waiting to see you you guys do next!

            <column name="review">Hmmm...There are many good ideas in this remix,
but for my taste there are also to many things that doesn\&#039;t work well for me. At first there aren\&#039;t any new parts. The ReMix is basically new cutted out of the original parts, and also the drumloop is still the same. For a ReMix I would wish myself a little more personal stamp of the creator. A little style of his own... the new cutted lyrics are good fun, but its not enough for a remix in my oppinion. And also the ending is a little bit boring... there are more ways to end an remix than to make a fade out.</column>

            <column name="review">Ok. To be honest, this is my own mix, but I wanted to add a comment on this. I didnt like the original songs chorus impact that much, so I tried to make oit more powerful. Also to me it didnt really sound like a chorus, so I used the \&amp;quot;dance\&amp;quot; part as kind of the new chorus instead. The structure of the remix is not a typical remix structure, its more like the song how I would have imagined it. The noise in the back is not perfectly mixed though and now already to me sounds disturbing sometimes, also with the mp3 data compression, the sizzling highs of the remix beat and also the deep bass are gone. It sounds heavy though with the wav-file I mixed. So this is a compression sacrifice. So maybe Sacrifice Remix would have a better choise. ;) Cheers all.</column>

Everything about sucks.
If you say it doesn\&#039;t suck than you suck.
If you are still with me than you suck worst of all.
And if you don\&#039;t watch it I will mix you into this remix and there you will stay till you get some reprogramming or no longer are useful in any way. 
And if anyone comes asking about you I will look perplexed and then here is what I will say.  
He told me he was heading to Mexico but two weeks later I saw him in  The City turning tricks to get a fix and talking sissy and acting all gay.
I did notice he was wearing a t-shirt that read ....

All kidding aside ... some of the ideas are ok and a couple more are good.  But to declare this as ingenius or say that this is better than the original defies all but the most chemically influenced standards.

I suspect that hearing it every day has probably been punishing as well.

The original doesn\&#039;t have any melody to it, purposefully, so It\&#039;s great basis to add some melody, and dirty scarab does a great job to add that melody, but subtly instead of in your face. The piano work at the end really puts the cherry on top of a well iced version. great job. </column>

            <column name="review">I\&#039;m assumeing the reason this sn\&#039;t at the top is because people are impatient. LISTEN TO IT TO THE END!!!

I\&#039;ve just listened to this all the way to the end and i thought the ending was amazing. reminded me of the remix of bowie\&#039;s \&#039;i\&#039;m afraid of americans\&#039; by nin. this remix mirrors the nin/bowie one. the track is more electronic than the original and then spews off in an unexpected direction..the minor chords to major at the end is terrific. </column>

i di not give it 10 cause their maybe a better to come BUT
Your\&#039;e remix seems obviously at first listen but on further listening a very complex piece has been reconstructed.
will be on my current playlist for quite a long time
thanks for taking the time and sharing</column>

            <column name="review">I really dig how the rhythm has more bounce to it now and not so straight. I think the ending could actually have been snipped up a little (though I know another review3 on here completely contradicts me). 

It sounds like the balance really needs to be worked out in the EQ - some times it\&#039;s high on the high end, but the low is cracking too. Just a little FYI there.. 

Overall, good take on the mix - not too radically shifted or plug-in crazed! </column>

The unremarkable beginning gives way to some real creativity at the end. 
Attention to detail, especially with respect to volume peaking is always appreciated and worth noting since Todd took the time to make the adjustments that make for a smooth replay.
Overall good mix but can\&#039;t help but wonder where Todd might take us if he chooses to integrate the same sound choices he made  towards the end throughout the entire song.
Let\&#039;s hear more Todd!</column>

Sounds great too!
Listen, shoot me a call later.  I need you to put one of those mixed media slideshow productions together for me.
I just saw the one you did on San Francisco and loved it.

            <column name="review">This was a DAMN good mix. I instantly thought of blending Vessel and Closer together when I first heard the first verse of Vessel, but you beat me to it. Granted, I don\&#039;t have the mixing prowess to develop an even remotely good mix, but I have ideas.

This mix did a lot of what I personally had in mind though, and in most cases in the song did better than I had imagined. The only thing I want someone to do is blend the first verses of both Closer and Vessel together, since they go together nicely.

\&amp;quot;I let you put in it my mouth\&amp;quot;
\&amp;quot;You let me violate you\&amp;quot;
\&amp;quot;I let it get under my skin\&amp;quot;
\&amp;quot;You let me desecrate you\&amp;quot;
\&amp;quot;I let you pump it in my veins\&amp;quot;
[Right here though, when Trent half-hisses the word \&#039;veins\&#039; it\&#039;s not probable to put in the other  line from Closer, so I guess it would just carry over or something]

Anyway, you see what I mean. XD That really has nothing to do with your mix, just a thought I had that I wanted to get out there. But overall I highly enjoyed your mix and can\&#039;t say anything bad about it. </column>

            <column name="review">Hello people, I am Garrie and much like you all i love nin. This remix is jus my take on God Given much like how The bliss of ignorance was jus my take on Capitol G. these are\&#039;nt remixs as much as re-productions of the song, i\&#039;m not posting these to  make myself feel good and see how many people download them, i posted them cus i like it, and if anyone does like it i\&#039;d like to see a review and if you hate it even better i love the hate more. but heres my remix of God Given called God Damned, it\&#039;s a bit heavier and more industrialish then the original, i hope you all enjoy.

            <column name="review">Thanks for the kind review Cin!
Personally, this song still speaks to me when I hear it.
Of course being able to compose and rearrange music around highly talented musicians like Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails has a way of making the music sound good despite any hacking I do.
The other day I was jamming this song and a friend said something that caused me to turn the volume down. No easy feat by the way but she asked if it bothered me that the message of the song was selfish as in \&amp;quot;there is no You only Me\&amp;quot;.
With surprise I responded..Is that what you hear?
Because what I hear, what I composed around is ...\&amp;quot;There is no You! There is only Me\&amp;quot; as in dammit where are you?  It\&#039;s STILL no You and Still Only Me. and anyplace without You my dear whoever and wherever You are is Now, like always, a place I
do not want to be.
Without You.
Anyways with TR singing I know You have a better chance of hearing Me.
Thanks again.
Oh and one more fav for NIN in the bank if needed.

            <column name="review">Well you asked for a review , now you got one :-D
I\&#039;ve also remixed the song and listend to yours now... i like the drum sounds and the overall sound ideas. The piano line is well made and the surrounding soundscapes are good...
What i would wished myself is more or other vocal sfx on Trents vocals, they seem to be very like the original track... also a little more changing the chords or harmonys would do good to your remix.
Now it seems for me that everything lays on one harmony or very near around that harmony.
But nevertheless a very good remix.
Now take a listen to mine ;-D And tell me what i\&#039;ve done wrong or good :-D

Thought it was very well put together, not a massive fan of the piano bits in the verses although after a few more listens it might grow on me.

Peace out!

            <column name="review">It took me a couple of times to really listen to this track and pick it apart bit by bit to give it the critique I felt it deserved.  I hear three different people singing in this song, including Trent.  Is it more of a cover or a remix?  I can\&#039;t tell.  Either way it sounds fucking awesome, like the first time I took mushrooms and listened to the Fragile for seven hours while playing Doom.  This is a sick remix that can be appreciated for its dark, Switchblade/Collide-esque overtones.</column>

            <column name="review">Im glad u like the song Matt. I respect your opinion and i thank you for the honest critisism. However, my goal in this remix was to form a relatively heavy song into something beautiful and soft. As far as the music is concerned your right, it has little to do with the original song. Which was my exact intention. I actually wrote the music to this song with the MVH vocals in mind. So this music wouldnt have been created if i did otherwise. But i must agree with u matt, the music would go rather well with &amp;quot;in this twilight&amp;quot;. Either way, thanks for the review once again, i really appreciate it.</column>

I\&#039;d suppose I\&#039;d be a lot more playful with the form if I knew I wasn\&#039;t keeping the majority of the original elements.

just my opinion - take it as you want.</column>

            <column name="review">You know this composition has some very interesting perspectives to it\&#039;s musicality.
The creativity involved in the music arrangement is obvious but in my opinion hindered by the inclusion of  such very loaded subject matter.
Perhaps the intention is to engeneer some level of discomfort for the listener.  It certainly did so for me and unfortunately will end up being the reason the piece doesn\&#039;t get additional play on my box.
I am left with the feeling of wishing the lyrical content and theme were different because the musical composition is very good.
But that is my problem isn\&#039;t it.
Unfortuneately there are not many places that I wuld not feel extremely self conscious about playing a song whose theme is so likely to offend.
THat having been said I hope the composer can find away to expose me to more of their unique musical arrangement without  the need to disturb me as much with the lyrics.

            <column name="review">`i disagree with the previous comment.  i think this remix is plenty creative.  excellent production value and instrumentation.

it certainly stands out from the original.  reminds of \&amp;quot;die warzau,\&amp;quot; early chicago industrial, warzone 1 stuff.

chorus is gutsy, tongue-in-cheek disco.

i like the \&amp;quot;through-the-phone\&amp;quot; effect as a motif in the track.</column>

            <column name="review">i really dig the beat on this track, the switch-ups.  its a very \&#039;manic\&#039; reworking, but the chaos is an effective element.

the breakdown is excellent.  an overall great track.

though, i might suggest changing or progressing the melodic samples a bit more into the body of the song.</column>

My only complaints are the end is too chaotic for my tastes and there\&#039;s too much sampling of unrelated tracks. I\&#039;d have preferred something a bit focused more. But the unique vocals let this remix stand out. Well done.</column>

            <column name="review">This is actually really good. The source material has been used well and changed enough to give the track new life, but not so much as to create a seperate entity.
The production is also very good, a lot of the remixes on here suffer from being put together badly and mixed terrible, whereas this track sounds very well arranged and mixed.
Very good!</column>

            <column name="review">Not my cup of tea. While this remix is well done, the distorted vocals and techno elements stick out like a sore thumb for me. The best part is the guitar riffs at the end. IMHO, a better remix would have focused more on that element, turning the distinctly mellow original song into something more hard rock-like.</column>

1. It\&#039;s too short.
2. There\&#039;s too much noise distortions.

What I do like is the hard rock feel of the song. Very upbeat and fast; less boring than the original version of the song.</column>

Other than that it\&#039;s like being in Waterworld in Mario Brothers, in which it\&#039;s cool to swim around, but after awhile you get tired and want to find the green pipe.</column>

All in all good track to chill to if you\&#039;re in the mood for an acid trip :-)</column>

            <column name="review">There are three qualities to this composition that prompt me to write a review.
In my opinion the song is engaging from beginning to end. The perspective is both fresh and innovative, at least to my ears. 
I am not exactly sure where this is gonna fit but I am sure it will make it\&#039;s way into my personal afternoon music set at least for the next few days. 
Finally the song does what very few can in my opinion. That is spark me to open up and begin work on another NIN remix. Trent Reznor mixed with Silent Narcotic make for a decent high I can recomend to all.
Good luck!

i liked the main synth line, really punchy.
You havent just rearranged the parts ,youve put in the effort to create a new tune,while still retaining the original vibe.
nice work :)</column>

Nice chords, bass is fantastic, vocal levels are just spot on. I really like the direction you took this in with the whole atmosphere and piano. 

I agree with a previous reviewer about the structure though...could have been a little more interesting. But otherwise, a near perfect remix. </column>

i dunno.  my suggestion would be to keep rooting through samples until your find something not as annoying.</column>

I clearly didn&#039;t add anything, obviously. See, the bass and synth and drums and samples and guitar they were all there in the original mix-- very quietly, secretly, and only on yours and my multitracks, I actually didn&#039;t change ANYTHING in the song, how silly of me.</column>

            <column name="review">Absolutely forward thinking. such a simple change creates an entirely different song.

With a lead in that takes your familiar machine gun NIN guitar and turns it into a radar sweep. stripping the beat down to a basic kit and using modulated and effected vocals as the backing of the beat it self.

the break, the beat, and the genius of this remix go far above and beyond anything i have heard on this site.

and i&#039;m a sucker or it&#039;s minimalism. there you go.</column>

In ways I feel this is a purer Survivalism than Survivalism itself, I love how the beats match up with the &amp;quot;I got survivalism&amp;quot; voice loop.

Anyway,

I really wonder how on earth you can like any music when you build something like this with notes all at odds with each other. How on earth are you hearing music? I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re under 20.
Go learn, you&#039;ll love it :)</column>

i&#039;m a huge fan of yours! I really like how you change the feel of the song. I really like how you put a new spin of everything you do. I also respect the fact that you replace quite a bit of instumentals with your own. That takes some serious skill and talent which you obviously have ;)
Thank you for another great song!!

AT some point, drop out of that wonderful distortion (the most musical I&#039;ve ever heard here) and go &#039;clean&#039;. Then WHAM back with distortion. As it is, it&#039;s all on one level, no rise, no fall. Not a very interesting journey.

It gets 6/10 as a track because it lacks dynamics, and that&#039;s pretty important in a good track...

10/10 for the warm distortion though.

What was used for the manifold distortions?

Izotope&#039;s Trash is good, so is overloading a cheap pre-amp haha.

            <column name="review">be good at beats = learn drums :)

No other way. It&#039;s about FEEL.

See the end of crashtv&#039;s remix of MVH - I can&#039;t remember which are programmed, which are NIN, which are Apple Loops, but I remember me playing something in there somewhere. I think there were 8 (9?) drum patterns running at the end.

Much fun.</column>

            <column name="review">hahah ignore that bruiser (not creative?).

This is what creativity is - taking something and melding it into another thing.

I love the sub bass drum in the chorus, that&#039;s way deep in the chest from my Behringer monitors and most welcome.

I think this has a great sense of humour. Nearly everyone here is so up their own arse, thinking they ARE NIN. Idiots.

Main crit - it don&#039;t go anywhere or do anything. So rating is 7.

You should have used some disco string falls.

And I hope Travolta&#039;s talking head was a reference to Futurama.

oh my god, okay, thanks.

And good to hear someone actually playing a guitar here. All crashtv remixes are re-recorded guitar bass and drums but no one here seems to like that :(

You done a nice job here building a dark environment. Nice guitar sounds too.

Just a tad over the top at the end with the white noise snare - it doesn&#039;t need to be so upfront, let all the darkness come forward - keep us in that dark place. Maybe use a clangy metal snare more distant.

Like it much.

My question is why don&#039;t you download this mix dump it back into GB or whatever and tighten it up a little bit?
Or give it some Stuartism.
Call it a collaboration.

The best aspect in my opinion is how the chaotic orchestral instrumentation parallels the equally chaotic techno instrumentation of the original Year Zero tracks.

            <column name="review">Here is some basic information about the remix:

I tried to take this piece to a bit different place, so I just used the lead vocal and reworked averything else. The song was just asking to add some new harmony to it. Still I didn&#039;t want to lose the intensity of the original.

Guitar is played live, everything else are samples, thank God for giving us MIDI.
Software used: Reason, Cubase

Enjoy!

            <column name="review">i really liked the concept but the deliberately dissonant melody from the original song clashes in an unpleasant way with the rest of the music. i think the mix would be better served by changing the last 2 of those notes/chords to something more in keeping with the rest of the music. but A for effort!</column>

Only problem for me is the lack of something different in the chorous ( first one really), but that&#039;s a minor crit and as with all music it&#039;s down to personal taste.

Some of the effects remind me a lot of the band Celldweller, and some effects you can tell are there for filler.

anyways, thats what I recommend.</column>

However I&#039;d love to get my hands on an instrumental version of it, it would kick some very serious ass!

I mean, as the title suggests, it makes a great music theme - and I like listening to soundtracks with movie/game music. This, as an instru, would fit that perfectly ;)

            <column name="review">Well, to combine it with that song layed on a hand, didnt it ? The beat was very obvious to use... well okay you mashed them up together...in the middlepart they are harmonicly very out of tune to each other.
The ending is getting better and sounds more harmonic to me... half the points seems fair to me for that mix , because it isnt really a Remix. Its a Mashup, well made... (except the middle part)
Now listen to mine and tell me what you think ! Thanks...

            <column name="review">I like the simplicity of instrumentation and the accoustic drums as opposed to electronic. And the piano is beautiful (did you play that?). It is, however, too simple I&#039;m affraid...especially the first half. I found the drum line during the first and second chorus to be anti-climactic. I will say, tho, that the smooth new age feel in the last minute and a half-ish is a nice contrast to the original.</column>

            <column name="review">I love the double-time aspect throughout. I also appreciate the scattering of snippits of lyrics throughout as opposed to a linear, full text. It&#039;s very trancey. I like the abstract &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; at the end. My only criticism is that there aren&#039;t any contrasting highs an lows. But, hey, maybe that&#039;s what you wanted, considering the title. Nice work!</column>

            <column name="review">In first:I&#039;ve heared much remixes of that track and did also 2 remixes of that track...
I like the middlepart (where the drums are muted) and again where the original beat comes in again... nice ideas...
Overall sound is great, but i think the drum and bass drums are a little bit too much in front of the mix... Well and the end is a little to abrubted , unless its no load error here...

            <column name="review">I&#039;m sorry that I wouldnt give you more points but i have some critcism on that &amp;quot;remix&amp;quot;.
For me a remix is more than aranging the original stuff a little in different order.
Also a great &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; is to pitch the vocals down that much ...
unless you want to archive a special effekt. And for that you should use it only on short passages and not the whole vocals. The pianotrack is well chosen, but your remix needs to long to catch the listener... try to shorten it or to build new elements in it.

            <column name="review">This remix is better than your other remix, though it is too short in my oppinion.
Also here is what i said on your other remix: don&#039;t pitch the vocals, it makes them sound strange. here you pitched it a little higher.
and through the higher pitch it becomes also faster. To use the same beat only in a faster way makes this song to hectic... you could do better than that, arent you ? 
Keep it up !!

The other sounds are great. I&#039;ve heared a lot of survival remixes but this one is one of the best !(And is this the Beasty Boys Drums I hear on that track ?)

            <column name="review">There are a few things I look for in a good remix - you had it all! I was drawn right from the beginning, great contrasts, non-linear, and you capitalized on and highlighted a few key points: like the &amp;quot;aahhs&amp;quot; - it actually gave me chills. The voices/samples you used sounded great and really complimented eachother. Your original synth lines for the chorus worked very nicely. And on top of that, your instrumental out-tro was fantastic...original, flowing, and mirrored the original concept. Excellent job!!</column>

            <column name="review">Just doesn&#039;t work for me. It lacks melody and harmony and is just generally noisy.

But then again, glitch just isn&#039;t my thing. Many of the originals on Year Zero wear me a bit thin sometimes to be honest, so maybe I&#039;m not the most objective judge of the genre.

I will definitely say I like the distortions near the end though.

In short, I&#039;m a big fan of your MVH rebuild and I wish this was more like that. I really like remixes with dynamic instrumentation.</column>

much to komplex or strange harmonics sometimes... if you can follow me ;-D
Maybe you should keep one (or the next) remix a little more simple... its mostly that the simple songs seems to be hard to make. All the best !
Keep it up !

            <column name="review">I admit there is a dim and turbulent quality to NiKKo&#039;s DarkMix version of My Violent Heart that I find very appealing.
On those rare occasions when I need a little balance towards the darker side this mix up should be a good way to get started.
Nice job NiKKo!</column>

            <column name="review">My first exposure to Impact Carrier was reading his well thought out input via the Shoutbox.
I just checked out his remixes and yes there is a solid body of work there a high measure of craft.
There an element to all his work that is both unique and unifying with a style that is subtle and for which I am quickly discovering a taste for.
IC&#039;s Exterminal  joins my group of favs destined for heavy play as I move and sit with people throughout the day.
Nice clean work Impact Carrier!</column>

And, being constructive here, when you do a remix, try putting your attention on the lyrics and then think, does your mix fit with what is told? In my humble opinion, this mix is good, even great!

No, Hang on, Badgers are too proficient in sound production...It must have been deaf millipedes that produced it.

The remix, being generous, I&#039;d give a 4. it ain&#039;t great. the production and general structure I&#039;d have to give a -4, which evens out to a big fat zero.

Next time, try attempting to do something vaguely original.</column>

Feelings do play a roll in the song, but if you don&#039;t have your own freaking sounds in it, it&#039;s the same, but rearranged piece heard over again, and how do we hear YOUR feelings. And putting a vibrato on the vocals don&#039;t count. :P</column>

            <column name="review">Really well done.  Starts almost too minimally but expands exponentially.  The layering and revision of structure is key to the success of this remix in my eyes.  Has a free-flowing and decidedly late 80&#039;s synth sound, but again, layering it all pays off.

Didn&#039;t care for the resolution of this track, but it is by all means very well done in its completedness.</column>

sounds a little like stuff from &amp;quot;justice&amp;quot;.

Good work ! And if its liked by the master himself it MUST be good ;-D

Check out my remixes too...

I like a lot about like this composition!
My only reluctance at rating this song higher is that I would like to hear it with more frequent Region Pitch applied as the rhythm and vocals recycle.
Good luck!

            <column name="review">You&#039;ve done a terrific job of establishing a mood and feel in the beginning, and a great job of leading that into the beat and mix of the climax. The only thing that could have been improved a bit was the placement of the vocals about 3/4 into the song. The gap between &amp;quot;There is no f****** you&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;There is only me&amp;quot; could have been lengthened some, as the latter part seemed a bit out of sync with the drum-beat. This aside, it was awesome. Good job : )</column>

            <column name="review">I really don&#039;t mean to be brutal but this remix is hardly a remix, in fact its more like you stripped all the interesting parts out of the song and left the remains dangling like a skeleton. If you don&#039;t understand where I&#039;m coming from then u need to listen to a great remix. Only-Teenage Robot Reprogramming by Ewun would be a good start. Perhaps this will help you on your next mix. good luck</column>

I didn&#039;t like it, found the  repetitive use of the grating loops to be unforgiving.

However, having said that, I&#039;m sure you can come up with something better than this.

The use of bombs in the background during the outro reminds me of when I was working in Israel and would try and drown out the Hezbollah attacks with Tool and NIN. 

Again, fantastic job and keep up the good work!</column>

            <column name="review">Racist as a tag? Really?I don&#039;t know where to begin on that. I was hoping to show how the religious impulse can be distorted by political power, in the context of this particular song, which was actually a great deal of the basis of Year Zero as a concept album.

Besides, religions don&#039;t count as races. And, the concept of &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; itself has been largely abandoned by biologists as genetics don&#039;t travel in discreet bundles, not to even mention how religion is a totally separate entity.

            <column name="review">Interesting take..I always wondered what a stripped down version of this would sound like.

I thought there could have been a little more variation because the piano became quite repetitive. Also, the chorus vocals at the end were a bit loud, making them seem out of place slightly.

Feel free to listen to my remixes. I&#039;ll admit they aren&#039;t perfect either.</column>

            <column name="review">Without wishing to seem unkind, this version needs a bit of polish. The additional use of the sample form TDS starts interestingly enough but then gets annoying from over use. The track feels like it should build up to something that doesn&#039;t arrive. There&#039;s no pay off for sticking with it. On the other hand, there&#039;s a reasonable skeleton of tune to flesh out. Needs more drama </column>

            <column name="review">Hi ! Thanks for your review on my remix of TBOTE... I&#039;m sorry that I couldnt give you more points in my review, but i explain why if it helps:
For a remix i think there are
to less new elements here in you remix. It seems like you took the original stuff and arranged it a little different. There are some good ideas, but not finished to the 
end. For my taste i would loved to hear some original style of your own and not an
slim-mix of the original...

hope i wasnt to hard in my words. nothing for ungood...

            <column name="review">Sorry I&#039;m not a fan of deliberately upbeat songs. But Seriously not bad for a first shot. A lot of potential here. the repeated use of the second verse really kills it. and the distortion isn&#039;t very complementary to the song. But the morphing to the vocals around the end are kinda cool. just don&#039;t overuse them in the future.</column>

            <column name="review">I&#039;m not too fond of how most remixes on this site of in this twilight are stripped down to bare vocals and harmonics. Although the tapping rhythm is a change for the better. I agrre with DJ Andr on the first chorus. you kinda dropped the ball and picked it up again. The ending drums didn&#039;t feel too fitting but i liked them alot.
And your suprise ending was kinda cool but i think people following the ARG fear copying that idea.(Plus Who&#039;s gonna spectrogram songs?)But Overall a good remix</column>

            <column name="review">Overall, this is a great variation from the original..  more of a jazzy sort of feel.  The beginning, personally, is my favorite.    Most of the remixes out there take the sonic form that trent projected in Year Zero.  In other words, one of the more original takes on a Year Zero song, or any of the other ones.   Good one!</column>

Better than my wish to hear at least one of them come in heavy but clear with amp sim and bass clarity.
Even so ... nice work twin!

            <column name="review">well, i think the idea is try to get away from how most of the remixes &amp;quot;are essentially gonna sound the same.&amp;quot;  not at all.  there are tons of things a person could do with this song, and i don&#039;t think re-arranging it is the most you could get out of remixing it.  what about your own sample?  synths?  differet drums?  how about scrap one entire element from the original in place of something  new?  however, i can&#039;t give you much kudos for your remix here.  not that i don&#039;t believe you don&#039;t put effort into this - but i believe you could do more.</column>

Only thing is it is quite repetitive and that is one thing I don&#039;t like about most remixes in general. I guess you decided to take the usual techno route but it does take the song to a new realm. Feel free to check out some of my mixes.</column>

            <column name="review">You have some really good things going on here.  The beat coming in and breaking down here or there is cool, the movement between &amp;quot;spaces&amp;quot; is also well-done.  My only complaint is the conflict between the added melody during the chorus and the original.  its still a cool sound, and sometimes dissonance does work.  Other than that, i think great.</column>

            <column name="review">Dig that beat.  Dig it very much.  The glitch is very effective, a nice touch to be sure.  You gave this song a whole new energy and cohesiveness.  The changes, new layers, everything arrives on time, keeps the song moving.  and that breakdown after the half-way point is great.  i also like how you sent the long buzzing bass synth to alternating left or right stereo field.  i enjoyed this remix.  my one suggestion is something to reinforce the climax of the song with something, even as simple as white noise or a low-grade sample.  otherwise, good stuff indeed.</column>

            <column name="review">its like the art of noise took a stab at the beginning and let the rest of the song roll out.  granted the beginning catches your attention and the shift between spaces is great, but i sort of wish that when the song picked up again we would hear more of your contribution.  mixing certain elements louder is okay, and the noisey-siren breakdown is interesting, i just wish you contributed more to the sequence of layers.  towards the end you do, but your vocal samples appear to off time.

not a terrible go, i woulde just recommend taking your noise ideas to the extreme.  let them further infect the song and distinguish it from the original.  strange though befitting ending.</column>

I only wish you could have found something more fitting for the chorus than the original parts, perhaps if you had kept the pads going and elevated them somehow.  my point being that the chorus and verse have such dramatically different emotional tones.  just talking out my ass.  it really is very good.  </column>

if you write to me with your e-mail I&#039;ll send you some more of our mp3s that haven&#039;t been posted yet, I&#039;ll have a free album done and posted online in a few months too.  Write me an e-mail sometime</column>

            <column name="review">this is pretty basic stripping-away of layers after the intro.  i wish there was something different going on, something i hadn&#039;t heard before.  the pad loop dropping down in volume and continuing into the second verse feels unnatural.

towards the third-way mark it gets into an interesting little breakdown before picking up again.  maybe if you could alter the sounds in some dramatic way this would work better.</column>

But i would prefer a version without the voice, because it doesn&#039;t work with tne music, in my opinion.
However, it&#039;s a great version.</column>

            <column name="review">Gary, I did not detect any &#039;Hyperpower!&#039; in your track at all. I don&#039;t dislike this mix, I just found your desicion to name it a &#039;Hyperpower!&#039; remix confusing.

Above all else, I am most confused with your choice to remove everything that was &#039;dangerous&#039; and militant from this track and replace them with a musical manifestation of happiness. </column>

Only complants are I think at the very end the Great Below melody could be louder, and i&#039;m not so much a fan of the Ringfinger sample. It kind of takes from the &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; quality the song had....or maybe i just don&#039;t like Ringfinger...</column>

for the most part this was excellent, though like mike says not too much done, perhaps this is why i still like it so much.

            <column name="review">James, this is beautiful. I&#039;d the music you composed is wonderful and can stand alone with no vocals. though i really like sections with trent just speaking, i think it would reach aan even broader audience with out the louder hard vocals. 

I agree with both Matt and youself with regards to In this Twilight, this &#039;sound&#039; would go wonderfully. 

that said I hope you take the time to compose another song to mix with that song as well.

Beautifully done.</column>

            <column name="review">dude all through the years trent has been trying to GET OUT from under his label for the past 8 years. His music has to change because it is industrial and this is where the technology comes into play. Why wouldnt he change his music if he has new toys at his disposal? his fan base is more rabid than ever and only getting larger, if he is such a sellout and un-origonal why arent there any bands that sound like them anywhere without copying? And why couldnt you find a song of your own?</column>

About the &amp;quot;not much done&amp;quot; comment, the idea of this remix was to do the song as if I was doing it from the beginning. So everything you hear there has been ENTIRELY made by me except for the noises during the last chorus and, of course, Trent&#039;s singing. I&#039;ve put a lot of work in making it sound almost as clear as the original, and add my touch in the mix.

            <column name="review">Your body of work on here is becoming fairly impressive Gary. 
I have noticed that your original and inspired music has more of a audio electro sound that features piano as the primary.
Ever thought of combining that sound with the heavy beats and NIN vocals like you do in the remixes?
Good work!</column>

I like your song but if I could make a suggestion or two. This song would grab me faster if it was cropped to where more of the action is at the beginning.  
Miki don&#039;t look at any song as being complete too soon. For instance you could take this song and reload it into your editor and add effects or instrument overlays.
If you aren&#039;t sure what I mean and are anywhere near the bay area, get by and I will show you what I mean. 
Good luck!

(not being an ass here)Compression and EQ? How do I start? You have got to be running some kind of software to be remixing, right? Acid, GB, Logic, Cakewalk, Cuebase...something? I&#039;m sure you know about plugins, search in google just type &amp;quot;free VST&amp;quot; and you should get links to tons of freebies, look for an EQ and Comp you like and download it, you may already have some in your own library? Compression, you can do this to individual tracks (maybe to get that BIG kick sound you want, or to keep things at a certain level, ...etc) but always you should really compress the entire mix. Multi-pressors compress a range than you control( kind of like an EQ mixed with it) the freq. EQ&#039;s there are tons of EQ&#039;s out there, find a really nice parametric and along with your normal channel EQ find another channel EQ with at least 24 freq channels. A limiter always helps as well on the overall mix, try to keep things at a constant level ( a rough job even for the pros). And if your not already you might think of running different tracks on different buses to an overall bus into your main output (I hope that wasn&#039;t too hard to understand...) 
A quick... lesson on Comps, really more of an thesis, Ratio plus Threshold equals Gain Reduction. (need more help on that?) There are lots of stuff online about sound mixing and producing, search for them, (a PDF or text files, something you can read up on and learn to play around with without being too hard to understand) they will have more info than I can type here.
For instance on this song (my thoughts, no slammin your stuff, O.K.) the vocals and music at the start could have been brought up to more to a fuller level, and the distorted drums are cool, but almost too loud it over rides the rest of the mix. A Comp can fix that, so you can still have the soft vocals and music you might want to start with but won&#039;t lose heavyness if you want to bring it on (if done right it keeps you from overloading your sound and keeps everything constant and full). I would also might think of investing in some nice power monitors, I know they are expensive but, they really give the full spectral range of what you are mixing, headphones are nice but they allow freq to be missing, overbalanced, distorted.. you get the idea. (THIS IS NOT A BRAG!) I just saved up and got some nice Tanoys self powered blue series, I think they are the best they were near 500 each though :( , but even Makie makes em for under 100 each, and lot&#039;s of other companys, When I listen to some of the stuff I&#039;ve done on those monitors now...I wonder why I even put some of that crap out...ugghhh. (and you really need a pair if your doing stereo mixes, trust me you&#039;ll be amazed)
I hope I&#039;ve helped you out a little, hope to hear more tunes from you soon.</column>

He&#039;s just starting to use Acid Pro, and he&#039;s a beginner mixer. You don&#039;t need to trash people for trying something. Honestly, can you post something here without getting totally trashed? Sometimes. Trash the music, not the composer. And by trash, I mean  use constructive criticism.

As for this mix, I&#039;m not exactly too fond of it, partly because I get a bit annoyed of &amp;quot;Only&amp;quot; mixes nowadays. And I&#039;m not sure if the title was meant to trash Miki, but if it was, you can expect a good rate change. </column>

            <column name="review">Very interesting stylistic composition from Sam Swiech.
Nice!
Sam would love to hear this with the synth and drums set to either G or D/b which might better separate the vocals from the instruments.
A slight volume or reverb check on some of the individual  tracks would allow me to enjoy this song at high volume without speaker peak.
I like your perspective!</column>

It&#039;s a nice mix. I didn&#039;t know you could upload surround MP3&#039;s.
Dig the hand drums wish there were more. I have just upgraded my studio so hopefully I can start making so better sounding mixes.
Thanks again, good job.</column>

Most of my drums are loops I&#039;ve made live or with the computer and drum machines, sometimes I&#039;ll just filter out what I don&#039;t like and use the rest, others are pre-made samples that I&#039;ll cut, filter, and most always throw in effects, I also do all my own synth and keys, and most guitars. I use a lot of different audio sofware, but when it comes down to it, I always go back to Logic for post work and native insturments (core bundle pack) for most of my main effects. I&#039;ve just got Logic Pro 8, and some power monitors (which cost me...ummm my life, very expensive but worth every penny so far). I&#039;ve found live drum samples have a different feel to my mixes, so my library is full of tons of drum samples from hand drums to electro and full kit stuff I&#039;ve played. I really try to takethis site serious, but they don&#039;t seem to be as &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot; here compared to remix.nin.com, I&#039;m trying to bring a little of that here, but it seems like the community really doesn&#039;t want it...? </column>

(In v1.0, it was cut out.)

The Nyx Avatar quotes used are (in order):

&amp;quot;Alongside time, exists fate. The bearer of cruelty.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Celebrate life&#039;s grandour. It&#039;s brilliance, it&#039;s magnificence.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;To find the one true path, one must seek guidance amidst uncertainty.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;It requires great courage to look at one&#039;s self honestly, and forge one&#039;s own path.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;One of life&#039;s greatest blessings, is the ability to persue one&#039;s goal.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Only with strength can one endure suffering and torment.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;The silent voice within one&#039;s heart whispers the most profound wisdom.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his fate.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Man clings to a dim hope.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Beyond the beaten path lies the abosolute end. It matters not who you are...Death awaits you.&amp;quot;

I do believe that covers it all!</column>

            <column name="review">Just got a chance to really listen to this mix. 
It&#039;s a deep mix, a message, a signal.
I am beginning to recognize that your music is driven by a deliberate intention to be expressive rather than simply generate a catchy tune.
Very interesting!</column>

            <column name="review">There are so many things I like in this mix. Great separation of the sounds. Nice sense of urgency. Especially that frenzied synth/piano/guitar sequence towards the end. Even though my head is telling me that part sounds like it couldve been or shouldve been cleaner, my ears keep telling me to hit and play that part again and again. Simply smokin hot man!</column>

            <column name="review">This remix is fan-fucking-tastic! A near perfect danceable mix to a personal favorite of mine from The Slip. My only gripe is the placement of the vocals in the chorus. The melody, rhythm and length of the chorus was kept true to the original, but the vocals have been shifted 1 measure toward the beginning of each line, and hearing it made me feel that it sounded terribly out of place. If there is any way the artist resonsible for this mix could just leave the vocals in the same placement that they were originally in, this would sound perfect, honestly. Whoever you are, you did a great job with the mix musically. If you&#039;d just shift those vocals up to their original locations in the chorus, you&#039;d be sitting on a masterpiece worthy of making it to the halo 28 cut. Bravo!</column>

            <column name="review">Nice! This remix has interesting effects and adds while sticking close to the  delivery of the original. Rolls along nicely from beginning to end without the lag or lulls that those supposedly &amp;quot;in the know&amp;quot; insist are necessary for a successful song.
This plays well R.h.oZ.!</column>

The only criticism I have for it is that Trent&#039;s vocals, though they are definitely in sync, don&#039;t seem to fit the song at some points, which is a shame.  

Honestly though, it&#039;s probably just me.  Great job!</column>

First of all thanks for the support on the site... Hope you&#039;re ok... I&#039;m going to see NIN on October...! and this is a great mix, I like the instruments a lot, but I think it would have gone better with the chorus line differing a little in the song.
Anyways great job, hope to hear more from you!</column>

            <column name="review">Hey Dude.
Very interesting how a few songs ago you were a new mixer I noticed, then you did a couple of songs I liked. 
But with this one... Konga Man 2000 I have become a fan.
Liked this beat and felt it was bold in timing, patience and length of the track. The fx sounded slightlloud in proportion to the body of the song but played well with the imagination and did indeed keep it interesting through out. Full sound and very clean. 
Much enjoyed!</column>

            <column name="review">FYI - When I first heard 2Tom 182&#039;s song I thought it sounded excellent. Subsequently I asked for and received permission to remix a specific portion of the song after which I added my own vocal tracks, some synths, f/x-machguns as well as some volume pans and other edits. In my opinion the credit for the sounds that are the strongest and sound the best should go to 2Tom 182 and TR. The other adds were done basically to suit myself and were not intended to either impress or appeal to others. Regardless, I do appreciate 2Tom 182 letting me experiment here and the feedback and constructive criticism.

            <column name="review">Lots of groovy shifts in this song. More attention to customizing the vocals would allow me to more fully embrace the otherwise excellent musical tour.
Also the final mixdown edit could benefit from a little bit more impartiality. Application of the &amp;quot;when in doubt delete&amp;quot; philosophy would in my opinion make for a stonger tighter overall presentation.
Lots of good work here John!</column>

Your music is pretty f*cking fantastic overall, but the machine-gun like beat seemed to jump out at me in the middle of the song.  That&#039;s all.</column>

The drumkit f/x was a great add!
The mastering sounds good to me and plays well using my best speakers.
Very nice Riot!</column>

            <column name="review">I appreciate the criticism ryan.  I totally get what you&#039;re saying about the piano -- I was going for what I guess I could describe as an anthem vibe.  I initially tried to distort the piano to accompany the vx better, but it didn&#039;t sound right either.  This mix just wasn&#039;t meant to be ;) but to me, that&#039;s what makes it interesting.  Thanks a lot for the feedback guys.  

Moriddim, I appreciate the kind words; reinventing was exactly the angle I was going for -- I never really liked the original... although I definitely appreciate it more now.</column>

I often wish I could give a more technical review. You and a few others deserve it.
Enjoyed this one!</column>

Good clean work!
I must admit that I didn&#039;t care for the applause ending as it is currently applied. That could be a notch or two tighter in volume and will need additional attention to blend in well.
Overall nice sound AG!

Shoot me an email at enjoykd@gmail.com and I&#039;ll work on combining the two.  Mostly I love the broken drumline... makes this unique and cool.  I think I can make it even cooler though :)</column>

            <column name="review">not bad - a little samey start to finish and something was going on with strings lost waaay back in the mix. It sounded like aimless fiddling. Use it or remove it :)

Also it just stopped like it was on pay per listen and time ran out.

I agree about the machine guns but at least they sounded like machine guns as we know them hollywood style. 

(They don&#039;t actually sound anything like that - they crack.)

fairly cool stuff though.
6/10

You can do a lot better if you can mix this. Learn some MUSIC. Hey, how can it NOT help :)</column>

That&#039;s an excellent bit of Thunder - were&#039;s that from? Seriously interested to know. I&#039;d pay decent money for that.</column>

            <column name="review">I like what you did with this mix. You took a very different approach to most people and gave it a more of an industrial feel. Must have been a very difficult song to work with. 

Personally, I thought the distortion on the drums were a little weird for a NIN track, but its just my personal taste. I actually like this track.

Good job.

I&#039;ll be honest and tell you I would have liked to have heard you go for some deeper changes in the beat. Changes in either tone, sync or overlay. You know the old give them a taste and then take it away and then bring it back formula.
I do like what you did. Can&#039;t wait to hear more!</column>

            <column name="review">Hi Boss. 
First of all I appreciate you taking the time to give of us more of your musical perspective. 
I like this song. The details make it quite interesting and your efforts to re-master have paid off. 
In all honesty I think that the opening works well with the song as titled but gives me a dated feeling that echoes into the song.  Given the current feeling of optimism  why not start it on the.. &amp;quot;To America&amp;quot; and give it a more now feel? There also may one or two opportunities to run that opening back in as a chorus as is or even synth a sized.
Overall nice composition. A little to much Bush is why I left off a star.

            <column name="review">Ya at first I didn&#039;t think I liked this because of the effected bass. But that sic guitar and vocal fix eventually got the best of me. The frenzy towards the end is very nice.  
Pacifist I hear a lot of what we all like about TR. This arrangement is nice.. it&#039;s nice ok. But how about showing us what you are all about a little more prominently on the next one.
NO NEED TO SHOUT either except for when using our rockstars name.

Highlights.. well for one thing the balance, I mean the entry and exit of instruments as well as the sensitive application of the effects that keep them from getting away from you. I admire the way you(both) were able to keep your eye on the bigger picture.  
Enjoyed the listen but also learned something here. 
And more.
Thanks for the share!

            <column name="review">I am not at all against what you did here. Matter of fact you earn a stroke just for doing something different rather than sounding like another in the sea of NIN wanna b&#039;s. 
If I was allowed to make one editing decision I would probably start the track about a third of the way in right after the &amp;quot;beginning of the end&amp;quot; vocal. 
That would make for a little tighter song imo. Still plenty of TR which is what we all want to hear but it would get you into that nicely placed bass faster and give the ears a little more balance to the other instruments.
Regardless, give us some more Flatlander.

            <column name="review">Just speaking personally here.. as I develop more patience I find myself moving more and more Tweaker Ray tracks into my top level archive. Some of the elements I find most compelling in his treatments have to do with things like originality and production as it relates to overall sound quality. He also demonstrates the ability to project and incorporate a sense of urgency and/or patience into the music tracks.
Tweaker Ray consistently delivers the goods!

Don&#039;t worry about other mixes sounding superior. We all have been there. The important thing is you are here.
I did like the way you chorused out the piano and the clean sound in parts of the song. 
I would encourage to continue to experiment. Ideally what many of us including myself would like to hear would be more of your unique music and sound perspective.
Good luck and welcome aboard!

            <column name="review">Hi Craig. You asked so I wanted to give you my perspective. 
My initial impression was that the sound is clean and the song has some strong areas but in all honesty I think you stay a too long in some areas. The beat you finished up on got my foot tapping. If you bring that up front, either as a layer addition or single track it would be a great to capture my attention right from the start. What you choose to do from there in terms of cycling and change ups if planned well will have me reaching to turn the volume up. 
There is a lot here to work with. If you decide to pursue remixing this and have any questions feel free to ask via the shout. My experience has been that the contributors as well as the administrators are happy to respond with tips. 
Like to see you go off on this one.
Good luck!

I hear some parts I really like, for instance when the synth comes in over the beat... from there on into the great chorus, sic beats and on into TR going off the hook with &amp;quot;I will use everything I can&amp;quot;.
All that stuff gets me jumping heavy into this mix. 
Both the original title and mix make me feel conflicted. A little guilty for enjoying this so much.

            <column name="review">Thanks dude, the one thing I learned from this track was that if your mix isn&#039;t completely perfect in wav form, it won&#039;t translate well in mp3... I originally had a really neat intro for this, and that along with some of the drums and deeper pads just didn&#039;t translate well into 128 kbps or even 160 kbps mp3 no matter what I did.  I&#039;m actually kind of ashamed of this but I&#039;m really really glad you liked it.  Thanks for the feedback :)</column>

            <column name="review">Like the intro a lot. There are are some great spots for sure. I would have liked to hear the synths done differently the second and third time around. Also the volume peak is in my opinion low and I get a better listen by downloading and reducing by 25%. 
Like the way you did much of the vocals, multidirectional, arrangement etc. Overall I like more than I dislike and hope you will continue to develop this further.

You may have other people fooled by &amp;quot;dissonance&amp;quot;, but this simply wont impress me. I gave you two because the actual sound quality isn&#039;t bad.

A shitty mic setup ( bad pre-amp ).. I had my DAW setup wrong .. no interface , and i couldnt hear myself in the headphones .. LOL .. Had alot of latency in the recordings .. Really i just had fun with it .. Maybe someday i will re-dem myself with a much better remix .. By the way this was the 4th song i ever recorded a &amp;quot; rap &amp;quot; for ..

            <column name="review">I really, really like the premise of this track. I personally disagree with the spacing of the vocals during the faster parts, and think the track would benefit greatly from a Build drop pattern that is a little less... sudden.
On the whole thought I think it has a lot of promise!</column>

            <column name="review">I was skeptical but you convinced me.
Still I would like to hear a little more of the different than more of the same.
Start this right in the middle sounds sic too.
I do like a lot of TR and this has hit. Wonder what it would have sounded like to skip the NIN bass and instead stick with that sic beat behind TR on through to out. 
In my opinion the mix is not a 10, first because that is a figment of our imagination and secondly because I can hear most of this in the original. 
I am not gonna blemish your five star score because that is not why I am commenting.
Good luck!

            <column name="review">Hey James interesting take on this song. 
Somewhat placid with trippy little glitches here and there. Yes much potential. Especially given your comment below which is very kool.
I agree the piano is a pleasant add. Needs better separation etc. 
Try bouncing just the music tracks via Export To Disk and then dragging that from Finder back into the original project. Solo that and the vocals and the compression alone may offer better separation. 
Good stuff!</column>

Great interpretation. Excellent adds. Nice surprises. 
TR sounds good in practically everything but for me a mix stands out when the music takes a different but highly supportive direction than the op.
Anyways nobody gives one fuck about what I&#039;m saying so in summary play this thing loud. Thanks for sharing!

Ro 1 is his mom, but she hadn&#039;t had him at that point.
TARA (The TARDIS I Gave an A to) wanted me to see him.

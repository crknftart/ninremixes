            <column name="review">Wow. When I opened up this song in iTunes I figured it would be a poorly done remix with things all jumbled together and whatnot. In a few places things seem to get a bit rough with the vocals but it\&#039;s definetly an amazing remix. There are two things I\&#039;m wandering though, 1) how did you get the vocals to sound as though you cut them from and accapella track? 2) what software did you use to cut this remix, it\&#039;s much better then most of the things I\&#039;ve heard done in ACID Pro.

            <column name="review">damn. i hate to say it, but i almost like this mix better than the original! i didnt like the whole tamborine-thing from in the original version (eventually, it grew on me). this one has a much deeper feel to it, and i felt like i was immersed farther into the mood of the song. all the extra layers make it so bold, and having the original vocals i think compliments it perfectly. certain effects make it seem like a more grown-up version of an old song, very reminiscent of the pretty hate machine era, but much more modern.

The fiercest, most evil broken beat DnB, completely twisted audio terror. The production is professional, the sounds are nasty, the drums are set to \&#039;obliterate\&#039;...

When the beat comes in with... \&quot;now that I\&#039;ve decided not to stay... makes you bounce and really gets you to stick with the song. i think i\&#039;ve listened to this mix more than the original! beautiful job.</column>

            <column name="review">Almost perfect. First the good: overall, the song is extremely well performed and a wonderful reworking of the original on Halo 17.

Here\&#039;s what I didn\&#039;t like:
- The beginning is too noisy and too long (almost 30 seconds). This alone probably tuns off a number of people to the cover.
- At a few times it sounds like the vocals are out of key. Specifically from 2:15 to 2:42. They improve but still sound somewhat out of key until 3:10.

I absolutely love the rest and the song remains one of my favorite NIN covers. Thanks for sharing it with us!</column>

Thats how i can explain this remix.... first two seconds sounds chopped off/faded and last two seconds are also faded but gets kinda loud... but!!! awesome work!
This is currently the only remix for \&quot;Non Enitity\&quot; and yes, this is how i expected it to be... Can\&#039;t wait for official release by Trent.</column>

It\&#039;s a hell of alot better than most NIN covers, I\&#039;d say worthy of one of those tribute cds but that\&#039;s not really a compliment, but take it as one.

The piano is the best part of it, but the version runs a little too long.

I\&#039;m not keen on the female vocals, I think if reorganized could be a very strong dub mix.</column>

            <column name="review">geezUS,  this remixer kills me every time i see a new one from them.   this one is just as good as the closer/last mix.  and that one was of greek god status.   

for the review,  first off,  man the selection of songs you mix is excellent by itself.

but the actuall work of the mix in and out with the multiple ideas and relations that they thrive off is amazNINg.  the explosion at 1.24 secs makes me wanna grab the nearest object_ and smash something with it.  excellent in and out fades new portions included = a complete reality of me putting this on a disc and taking it to the living room to burn_ my stereo equipment to the ground.....

thanks again, 

for yet another top fNINg dollar remix.

I couldn\&#039;t figure it out how you did with the instrumental part without hearing any metallic noises in the background. However, I can still barely hear the lyrics, \&quot;I cannot go through this again\&quot; playing as well in the background...just barely. Otherwise, it wouldn\&#039;t been a great instrumental mix. But still, a nice instrumental mix.</column>

Hate to say it but, it kinda went downhill and out of beat which it didn\&#039;t sound right at the end. What happened man?!! :/

Well, that slight error in the mix cost you a perfect score. However, I still like this cool remix of yours. A 9! :) </column>

            <column name="review">Personally, I did not find this mix enjoyable at all.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that it completely ruined what was an awesome song.

It\&#039;s not a bad concept, but the vocals were just so horribly nasal that I found the song unlistenable.  The vocals were entirely too loud as well.

Also, what is this song about?  It doesn\&#039;t make any sense.  \&quot;Tell me now, why you (word missing), hurry now... (something about hands around your throat)\&quot; 

Like I said, it could have been an interesting concept, but some songs are just best left without words. Now I will never be able to listen to The \&quot;Persistence of Loss\&quot; without hearing those nasal, high-pitched vocals and incredibly cliche, emo lyrics in my head.  I have no idea how this song made it to the top of the list.</column>

            <column name="review">Wow... This remix is amazing.

I really got suckered in by the beat. But I believe the best part is the mixing of Trent\&#039;s voice. Instead of making it sound cheesy and easily recognized as a mix, you made it flow and sound perfect.

I\&#039;m sure if you presented this remix to a person who hadn\&#039;t listened to the original song, they would never guess it was a remix, but an actual Nine Inch Nails song.

Be careful.. or Trent himself might try to steal this remix and pass it off as one of his own.

            <column name="review">A very unique and haunting rethinking of Only. This rendition gives a completly different feeling, and even a new view of what many of us have all come to know as the Disco track.

Vocally superb, harmonys in the later half of the track seemlessly blend together.

I can\&#039;t quite put my finger on it, but the vocalist has the voice of Maynard, or Eddie Vetter, which at some points make you feel like you\&#039;re listening to a cover by one of those more well known artists.

Dynamically, its smooth. Wouldn\&#039;t change a thing there.

Very nice transitions and scene changes from acoustic to distortion, and also a very nice flow, keeping you interested throughout the track.

Theres quite a bit more that I could continue to compliment, but for those reading, I\&#039;ll leave it for you to listen and decide for yourself.</column>

            <column name="review">first off, excellent mastering and recording.
I liked the different timing to the lyrics than the original.by about 1:25 it gets old, and after the chorus its almost like this artist took another song and dropped NIN lyrics in it and called it a cover. 

the chorus vocals are decent, but lack energy and the first \&#039;me\&#039; sounds a little off key. 

I really did like the song though and it is an excellent recording with great guitar, but i really have to wonder if it was a cover or just nin lyrics dropped in another song and matched with the timing. 9 on the music, but about a 3 as far as a cover goes, and about a 6 on the vocals.</column>

            <column name="review">Wow, what an unusual and well thought out remix. Usually I stray away from anything with \&quot;remix\&quot; in the title, and that is the case with a lot of official NIN remixes as well. But this belongs on an official halo_ disc. You really made this tasteful and well presented.

I especially enjoy the piano harmonies, and the slight dissonant tension created in the beginning.
Interlacing Trent\&#039;s voice and the rest of the song into your original composition is also very tactfully executed.

Good job. Can\&#039;t wait to hear more :)</column>

Its dark n sad at the same time , which fits the song very well for a cover . I wish I could give it a 9.5 , but I cant , I think a 10 would be a little much cuz A 10 for me is a perfected mix like the perfect drug or were in this together . Witch is rare to find .Plus this cover lacks a little origanality , Cuz there is alot of bands with this kind of sound musicaly . But Im not downing it in any way . Its awesome , So thanks for the Cover guys . Keep on workin on a defining sound , and giving us kick ass covers .

            <column name="review">Howdy guys,

I have no idea how to comment on my own song so just giving a bit of a heads up.

LittleJon- The song was specifically written for this. I basically wanted to completely redo Only and make it into basically the opposite of the actual song. It was hard placing basically spoken word and changing it to fit some kind of a melody. I decided to do this for about half of With Teeth but then gave up becuase I got a little bored with the project hehe. Your comments are welcome. Looking back now, the vocals could have been MUCH better.

Sick Messiah- The cover/reimagining was done by me :) Thank you for the comment though. I was trying to achieve a band mechanic. I guess I kind of succeeded.</column>

It\&#039;s a decent cover. The Chorus wasn\&#039;t a \&quot;wow\&quot; but the Intro &amp; the Ending was good..

Overall a decent cover. Good job, i see an APC influence here and there...</column>

The blending was very nice its like u can almsot seperate the versions, but they collide peacefully. Very well done, I will definitely keep a look out for the Lord\&#039;s remixes.

The guitars give it a Tool sound or something.  I could see how you could have gone two ways with this song, with the verses and choruses being so different.  It gave me some ideas, heh.  I dig it how it is, though.  Dig!</column>

I\&#039;m surprised this isn\&#039;t ranked any higher. Although I would suggest picking up some better recording equipment before trying much else.

The new beats mesh with the original song very well for the most part, the only bit which sounds less than perfect is the ending guitar solo.

The song structure is not significantly different to the original.

            <column name="review">Interesting, describes it well. The orchestration is kind of cabaret, and the vocals never really pick up-- I would like this song much better if the voice became clearer, or louder. Also, the orchestration is a bit too simplistic. Otherwise, I actually enjoyed listening to this. Keep on trying~

If anyone would like a higher quality download (128k leaves a bit to be desired) you can visit http://www.jnftech.net/xai
It\&#039;s a small page, but I\&#039;ve made available 256K MP3 and FLAC versions of the remix.

My only problems are with the mix.  It could be a little more crisp.  I feel like the creators were trying to compensate for difficulties in syncing things up and mixing by drenching the it in reverb, as cover up what it lacked in texture.

That aside, this was great, better than most, to be sure.</column>

            <column name="review">ok.  I like the idea, but there\&#039;s definitely some work to be done.  First, the intro:  You\&#039;re hitting the right notes, but there\&#039;s no dynamic quality.  certain notes need to be more pronounced (louder) than others and vice versa (softer)  Also, you\&#039;re missing all the filling lines, that\&#039;s what makes the originall so beautiful.  You\&#039;re too fast as well.  It not the type of track you can use a metronome on.  It\&#039;s about feeling when and where.  Perhaps give the piano a bit of reverb too.  When the heavy part kicks in, I like it a lot.  But still some piano filling is missed.  Lastly, that last note, your \&amp;quot;climax\&amp;quot; seems tacked on and abrupt.  If you want it, you need to offer some build up to it.  All in all, pretty good.  I like the choice. </column>

No, this just doesnt sound good. Okay, i will try and find some good intelligent reasoning for my utter disgust by this song, but anything I say will be grossly ignored and unoticed in the same fashion as say, oh i dont know, aids in africa. Now, I dont want to make light of a terrible rampant disease, but i believe this is type of music heard far too much on my radio waves these days that rape the ears of my fellow man, and mine as well.

Here\&#039;s the deal, it sounds good to the same people that are creating a market for the worst music ever created since poison, and boy band and the rebirth of modern jazz.

I cannot express enough how wrong this is especially in a forum where people reinterpret already stelar music by legendary rock hero T Reznor.

But I\&#039;m not an unreasonable person, so what I want to see is you being better. Hell yes, you can be better, and you should be. I think that these people are fucking shep pandering to you and trust me they disgust me more than you. Because, in all honesty, you are trying your best, and i can see that, but Im not going to lie you.

This sucks, do better, you know you can.</column>

            <column name="review">Gritty.  \&amp;quot;steel teeth\&amp;quot; seems an apt title.  this remix grinds; i like it.

love the new riff.  love what you did with the \&amp;quot;i cannot go through this again\&amp;quot; part and how the noise comes crashing back afterwards.

the effect on the chorus kind of takes away the impact, in my humble opinion.

Would have given you an 8 (a 10 being a nine inch nails quality song), but the mix sounds a little muddy.  It adds to the mood, but personally I think it would still be gritty if everything were more clear.  Not necessarily the remixers\&#039;s fault, though.  </column>

I liked this rendition a lot.  you got the beat down and all of those spooky atmospheric moments from the original.  i gave it a 7 cause i would\&#039;ve like to have heard the vocal bit near the end, as i believe it would have completed the progression of the song as i listened.

but very excellent work!</column>

            <column name="review">Is this an updated remix you posted before? i think the original was better.  i agree that the reverb is over-kill.  in fact, i think the added effects muddy the song considerably.  the editing is very interesting, not bad, but i would have left the stuttered bit of vocals out.

            <column name="review">somewhere between nin\&#039;s \&amp;quot;still\&amp;quot; record.  but that piano chord progression is very pleasing, and the sounds are generally well thought out.  an overall good effort, and i\&#039;m not sure what i would have done differently.  my real criticism is that it sounds too much like \&amp;quot;still,\&amp;quot; and while that isn\&#039;t a bad thing, i guess i just look forward to hearing something further off the mark when i see an original track put up.

nothing for singer - whats with dropping the H ?

it really bugs me... it sounds like a bad finnish band... like it\&#039;s the dudesons singing along to terrible lie....

if i did this i would have dressed up the synths a bit in the chorus... it\&#039;s a little too simple giving it a cheap midi feel...</column>

Great mix, for thicker sounds just run it through a Midi cable into a quadraverb and mess with the settings, or something like an AN1X or any MC-505 like roland knob box.

            <column name="review">Alright....

I dunno if I like what you did with the song to be honest. The chorus is lame. 

The vocals would be tight if you didnt drag on your voice and really gave it some emotion.

But Its not so bad. I enjoyed it just wanted more from it.</column>

            <column name="review">IT&#039;s very good, however, it gives me the feel you were listening to Closer To God album while making it.
It&#039;s almost a loud and crackly deviation of, well, maybe Closer [Deviation].
Though at the last part it clearly indicates how it is different from Closer [Deviation].

Who is speaking? I couldn&#039;t quite hear.

Anyway, it&#039;s pretty good, as I&#039;ve said before, but why drink sparkling cider when you have vintage champagne, you know?</column>

            <column name="review">Ok, here&#039;s an unspoken rule for ya [that I think mostly applies]: no animal sounds in nin remixes unless the song is called closer, okay?
[No, wait, maybe pig noises would be ok in *fuckers.... whatever, I don&#039;t control the world. :( to that.]

[Alternately, NO using baby sounds IN the song Closer. That&#039;s just, er-hem WEIRD.]

As for you song...since it&#039;s starfuckers, I kinda expected it to be noisier and louder. Very good in the beginning, lost it&#039;s way on the end.
Hope you get better at Acid!</column>

Ack! D8

Around 1:50ish, maybe earlier, when he starts singing, it&#039;s reminiscent of Freddy V. Jason, when the little girls are playing patticake and singing that, &#039;one, two, freddy&#039;s coming for you...&#039; song.

All in all, ten. I really like this!</column>

You were up against it from the start because all you had to work with was bad quality recordings, but this turned out really nice. A structure that kept you guessing, and some really fitting sounds were meshed with the original samples. At the risk of sounding like a Cliché, TWO THUMBS UP!!</column>

this is very poor... it isnt really a rich sound of the piano and only playing it without expression isnt the goal... as longer as i hear this its a shame to destroy such great song by a version without emotion and expression at least in the volume of the piano...

and in the middlepart its also played wrong...

i hope this version is only for learning how to sing over a great song... </column>

At first I thought the Metal remix with the new crunchy drums and Pinion sampling was the best, but this takes the cake, hands down. The Happiness In Slavery sampling towards the end and the little synth line that jumps up half notes; wow.

Maybe it was a programming error or whatever, but it simply didn&#039;t work for me.

The samples in the middle fit with the song, but I would try and not put two vocals together with one singing and one talking. I would have paused Trent singing, run the sample, and then start Trent again.

thats what I think anyways, overall pretty good though.</column>

One point less for your cover because there are harmonically some mistakes in my oppinion, because the harmonies on the bass arpegiator dont follow the right melody and so you got disharmonics in it... i dont know if that is wanted...
in my ears it sounds wrong...
also the ending is cutted...
wanted ? or unwanted ?
so i give you overall 9 points

            <column name="review">Wow... for picking such a hard coverversion you have my full respect. This Cover Version has great Elements and cool Ideas. One criticism: 
for me is that the vibe-synth
sounds too nice to me... if it would have been a little bit less powerfull or shiny than it would contribute to the overall dark feeling of that song. And the piano would have needed a little bit more reverb for my taste.
But overall a good coverversion!

I don&#039;t know what he is up too but, for a reason I can&#039;t quite put my finger on, I know in the end it will be  defined as significant.
Nice job JC!

            <column name="review">In spite of the many excellent layering, panning, and editing effects - and for all of its subtle nuances - I wish more happened with this track.  You have achieved substantial minimalism, and the track works fine in this regard.  But as a listener, experiencing your sounds, I wish they led somewhere.  I don&#039;t feel the progress of this track, fail to comprehend the melody (which isn&#039;t so important) and I wish you would do well to try throwing your percussive/noise loop through some filters.

Without context, it is hard to see the forest for the trees.

However, I think you have some very exciting and raw sounds.</column>

            <column name="review">You take your listening to some very interesting places, and never fail to find a way to open up ears and close them just as quickly.  To be perfectly frank, I enjoyed the piano/synthclav(?) interlude here.  

Your drum loop, after the bizarre false-start at the beginning, is in my opinion, unlistening.  This may or may not be a compliment or constructive critique, as i really don&#039;t know what you were trying to do here.  but you ought to know that the ear-splitting resonance of your drum loop, its sheer monotony, and lack of rhyme or reason, communicates two things to me, as a listening:

a) you are trying to experiment.  its cool.  please keep working as I see enourmous potential in your music.  keep in mind that if you want to safeguard your ears and that of those volunteering to listen, you need to watch those frequencies 2khz through 4khz.

b) you have utter disdain for your audience.  i&#039;m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that this is not the case, but if it is, then I guess I&#039;m a sucker.  I listened to your entire track, and now I feel I must apologize to both my ears and my waking mind.</column>

            <column name="review">I see what you were trying to do here, and at certain points the effects and editing take some very interesting turns.

I wish you had done more structurally to this song.  I don&#039;t think its enough to run the song through some filters and call it a remix.  maybe some other synth parts, maybe a new beat, perhaps a track with an identifiable rising and falling of energy over a period of time.

yes, tons of effects, but after a while i don&#039;t know what i&#039;m hearing, and its almost like effects for effects-sake.

also, on a personal note and having no bearing on the artistis merit of your remix, I wish you had left Mike Garson&#039;s incredible piano solo alone.  Sort of sounds like thats the part of the CD you start to fast-forward thru.  Thats just me, though.</column>

Almost beautiful.  considering your self-described musical ability, one of the more interesting experiments on here, and not at all a waste of time to listen to.  keep it at, and most importantly, keep challenging yourself.

            <column name="review">I swear, I review every Leaving Hope remix. LOL Anyways, I like what I hear. Aside from the weird breaks you mentioned I really have one thing. But this is just my opinion. You need to put more emphasis on the Piano. The Bass notes really drowns it out. (And yes, my speakers are set up right. lol) Because to me, the Piano is what makes this song. So maybe turn up the volume on the Piano? All in all, great work!</column>

            <column name="review">While the ideas behind the song are not terrible, there is a lot in the execution of the thing that bothers me, personally.  the singing is off from time to time, and that heavy reverb isn&#039;t changing anything.  lyrics aren&#039;t all that bad, they work with the minimal style of the song.  your synth patches sound like factory presets.  if they aren&#039;t, you should put a little more effort into the individual sounds.  and try to synchronize any arps with have going with the beat.

keep it minimal with more of an emphasis on each layers, each sound.  otherwise, an good effort.</column>

            <column name="review">Techincal errors aside, this is a really incredibly decent song.  there are obviously minor performance hiccups here and there, some rough mix issues.

reminds me of radiohead to an extent.  the piano and the guitar, once it has tastefully arrived later on, are my favorite elemtnes.  whereas so many people try to emulate another song instead of going out into new territory, i&#039;d say you&#039;ve done anything but a straight-up emulation of anything i can recognize.  

i enjoyed this song and i believe it is one of the best originals up here.  keep it up.</column>

            <column name="review">First off thanks for the kind words Finneus.  In response to the others our sound is based off of 90s and 80s bands primarily, I do listen new music all the time though (mostly underground, some mainstream). My girlfriend agrees (with Kyle) that it sounds 90s.  But I&#039;m really not bothered by that, I think bands should play what they want rather than try to sound modern.  I thought I&#039;d put our stuff up here since NIN is a huge inspiration on my songwriting and easily one of my favorite bands (Along with Nirvana, KMFDM and many others). Some songs I posted sound more Industrial (like Burnt Out) we try lots of styles (as future tracks I  post will show).  This studio recording was rushed because of money, the mixing is not the best, also I could have done better on the vocals with more time, so I agree on those points.  If we ever get a chance to rerecord it I&#039;ll put it up here.  Obviously Daniel didn&#039;t like it which is fine, I don&#039;t mind your opinion, a lot of people I&#039;ve given this song to (or who have seen our shows) enjoy it, some people don&#039;t like our music.  Nobody can seem to ever agree on what&#039;s good music, movies, books, etc. anyway so I understand that.  But about the pop appeal thing what I don&#039;t get is if you don&#039;t like pop appeal why do you listen to NIN?  Pretty Hate Machine is a pop record, Trent even said so himself, and his other albums still have those pop hooks that keep the song stuck in your head, even though there under 20 layers of strange noise it&#039;s still there.  Anyhow thanks to all for reviewing, no hard feelings just giving my 2 cents.</column>

            <column name="review">Personally, I don&#039;t think it needs Vocals. The Lack of &#039;em just give the rest more meaning. It honestly Sounds like redemption to me (Trying not to be cheesy) and i&#039;ve heard alot of redemption based songs. This is definitly one of my favorite instrumentals.

            <column name="review">Incredible, this is really catchy Industrial music. I can still hear it in my head about 10 minutes after I listened to it, so I felt compelled to write a review.  It sounds like it was written for vocals (especially the chorus) so good vocals would make it even better.  The ending has the feel of the ending of We&#039;re in this together now.  You should find some way to play this live, I think people would enjoy it.</column>

            <column name="review">i hate to be that one guy that has to say something negative...kyle is right about the drums in the chorus which sounds great but like the piano in Line Begins To Blur which uplift the song into a new dimension in the chorus..this lacks that.. you use the high pitched synth sound that doesn&#039;t blend well with the crunch sound..to me at least.</column>

If you like the original song at all, which is why your here in the first place, give it a listen all the way through. The singing isnt a 10 by any means but I liked the way he sounds in an eastern european way. The synth was played down but it was different thats why its a cover right. And the guitar at the end was cool.  </column>

            <column name="review">I have to say, I really liked the instrumentals on this. The only real input I can give would have to be:
1) The vocals could be a bit louder, perhaps even with a little less reverb on them.
2) The chorus (or if I&#039;m mislabeling here, the &amp;quot;Poisoned Society&amp;quot; bit) could have a bit more lyrical variation.

Aside from these things, it was it was cool. Keep up the good work : ).</column>

            <column name="review">I Just Thought I&#039;d give you my 2 cents. The Song Is still great but as I said on the other version, It&#039;s better without vocals. I&#039;m not a fan of Kyle Porter&#039;s Voice. Not many people on this site can do decent vocal work. No offense to Kyle. If You feel it needs more, try adding some more piano to the rest of the song. Or maybe some Guitars. Hell I&#039;d give a crack at doing the guitars if i had better computer to send some to You</column>

That&#039;s the worst I can say about this remix though, it&#039;s freakin great!  There is a creative blend of sounds and tones used.  Even a few well placed disharmonious and distorted points, which are truly the hallmark of industrial and NIN.

Brilliant work!</column>

            <column name="review">This was a strong effort, and there was obviously a lot of creativity in its creation and chose instruments!

I&#039;d like to make a couple of observations though.

1. Check your levels.  Everything more or less had the same tonal quality.

2. The crescendos were kind of there, but they weren&#039;t truly committed.  As you&#039;ll recall, the original had hugely dramatic crescendos, which is what really gave the song it&#039;s power.</column>

I thought it was brilliant but perhaps the second verse could have been shorter?
Very good mastering etc.
I really liked the harmonies, but would have liked more in there.
I think it sorted of sounded like a mix of Deftones, Tool and maybe even a hint of Nirvana!
Very good, could be perfect with a few tweaks.</column>

I don&#039;t speak very well english so i don&#039;t understand the lyrics but the music is good.
It&#039;s a kind of mix between NIN, Bauhaus (for the voice) and Marylin Manson (for the touch of glam rock)</column>

I&#039;d like to hear more,  or possibly an ending that falls apart? Just opinion of course. </column>

I get a feeling of escalation which drops off somewhere towards the middle though. By the end it feels more like a musical score than a stand alone song.

            <column name="review">very interesting reworking.  i&#039;d like to hear a few more pads when the music picks up, something to fill it in. i want more of your own personal sonic stamp on it in the way of new sounds.  otherwise, great effort!</column>

            <column name="review">At first I found myself wondering what Kyle Porter meant when he titled this song Sedition. 
But after a few moments I was able to stop contemplating labels and enjoy something that appears more personal than superficial.
I will be examining this song in greater depth. This effort deserves no less!
Kyle Porter is, I realize, a substantial talent.  
What is exciting is that there seems no end in sight!
Sedition by Kyle Porter earns my highest recommendation.</column>

I wasn&#039;t a big fan of this song until I heard the chorus, then I  played the whole thing and decided it was (one of) my favorite/s. Great job, any chance of a re-recording? I think your voice was a little too loud over the music, but maybe it&#039;s just me...

I think this would be good for a soundtrack, also.</column>

            <column name="review">I really like the structure of the this song, the production is pretty good.  Some really great musical moments in your arrangment, lots of movement and energy.

As for vocal, I hate your microphone, whichever you are using.  U need a condenser, something cheap like an AKG.  It&#039;ll sound a ton better.  Also, your voice is not the worst I&#039;ve ever heard, but your singing sounds sluggish, like Peter Murphy doing The Offspring.  Maybe its the inherent quality of your voice or the way you push air from your lungs.  In any case, doubling the vocals won&#039;t always excite them enough.  

Otherwise, really very nice work.  You are an incredibly decent songwriter.</column>

This, I know, is hard to remix because of the quality and the fact that it already has so much going on in it, but I dont even know what this is supposed to be.  It is so all over the place and it sounds like when I put a scratched CD in my CD player.  It&#039;s the most annoying thing to hear a song skip, so to make a remix made entirely of skips is not the greatest thing ever.  Sorry, but this person needs to stick to listening, not making music. I know thats harsh, but this maybe the worst remix Ive EVER heard!</column>

Is this an original? Might want to check into Trig.com (just do a google search) it&#039;s a free site made for artist/musicians/photographers... you can download tons of photos and music, kinda a my space for artist (without spam, email BS, pop-ups....)

This is my person site if you want to just check it out, it&#039;s pretty cool.

Thanks for the review, I always like to here others thoughts on my ideas, (good or bad), they should come up with a message board now they have the new accounts up.</column>

&#039;Here&#039;s a remix from the ninremixes.com collective that I found to be quite good. Like the creator, i too always wanted an upbeat remix of &#039;Something I Can Never Have&#039; as it was *the* song that truly turned me onto a continuos love/hate relationship with NIN while camping at a lake with exploding cans of spraypaint thrown into the campfire - I&#039;ll save the story for another day. While this track is good, it is only a cover. The vocals are tolerable and remind me of Zeromancer and need to be a bit more refined... regardless, thank you emhead for making this classic something that I can always have on a mix CD alongside Covenant, VNV and Assemblage 23&#039;</column>

Trent Reznor should be ashamed of himself for not releasing a version even half as good as this. This &amp;quot;Meathead&amp;quot; person is a true artist, you can tell he must have spent many late nights working on this and to much effect.

 Truly brings a tear to my eye to hear an artist putting his soul into mp3 format. Bravo Sir, Bravo.</column>

A little too fast for my taste and the swirly sounding thing during Trent Reznar vocals was distracting.  Kind of a one play song.. no offense but boring. Heard much better ones from you.
But like the other music profile! </column>

I didn&#039;t give it a 10 because it left me wanting some sort of climax that never came. I think it would be awesome if you just pulled out all the stops and went crazy with a guitar at the end or something. otherwise as just a flowing ambient/emotional track I do really like it and would prob give it a 10 for that purpose.</column>

I&#039;m trying to eventually put together an album but I keep releasing all the nin-genre songs here to see what people that have the same tastes as me like and what works and what dosent work. thanks for providing input it helps me out. Im always down for collaborations with anyone as well, I&#039;m certainly looking for a guitarist and bassist even just for fun tracks like these.

Very kind. Expect more Remixes from me ;-D

            <column name="review">Wow, I hope to write my own songs at this level. I love the stutter fx and and lushifier type effect on the synth/guitar. To be critical as we always are to better eachother, there were a few percussion hits towards the beginning that I felt were too loud for the mix since they hit so hard with high end. and maybe its just the original version that left me wanting for a harder climax where shit just goes more crazy at the end. Professional as hell though, excellent sounds, I aspire to be like you.

I think you introduced a little too much near the beginning of the song that made it just a bit draggy towards the end; I guess what I mean is that by the first chorus, the song is done building, and personally, I would build a little more tension throughout the second verse and chorus.  

I really liked the song, don&#039;t get me wrong; I&#039;m just trying to be a little critical.  Good work and nice reinterpretation :)</column>

            <column name="review">This is actually pretty well done, give yourself a little credit.  

Personally, I would add some more effects and emphasis on the vocals.  Maybe vary the beat a little bit as well.  Just subtle variations from bar to bar to hold the listener&#039;s attention.

The vocals are very thoughtful and unique -- the song as a whole gives me a Beck meets Zero Sum meets Fitter Happier by Radiohead feel, which is good.  

You did a good job but a little more effort in production would make this song even better.  All in all, good work and I&#039;d love to hear more.

I hope that helps.</column>

I would definitely change the guitar at the climax to reflect the progression of the original, just to maintain the atmosphere of Trent&#039;s work.

It&#039;s good to have other people that write listen and critique because you value their opinions more since they know how long it takes to put a track together. which btw I think it&#039;s crazy the amount of material you release on this site, and the time it must take to do that</column>

            <column name="review">First of all, let me say that I get geniunely excited when I see a new original tune up here by you, so that&#039;s gotta say something in itself.

Not listening on the best speakers ever at the moment but the beat is easy to get into, and the subtle hooks in vx and synth keep you listening even though the beat is fairly simple.  It builds very nicely.  

It&#039;s honestly a shame it ended when it did -- The ending was unique but took the surrealism out of the song, I would pull the little speech out; that&#039;s just my opinion though.

Great job!</column>

The song as a whole gets much better as it goes.. loses the initial vibe and goes back in the direction I&#039;m used to hearing from you, which is totally a good thing.

Good production work as always; I might eq/reverb the real-sounding drumkit in the middle a LITTLE differently, but that&#039;s just my vision -- it&#039;s good the way it is.

It doesn&#039;t feel too long even at 5:34, thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Keep &#039;em coming!!</column>

Ok so reviewing...  Beat is fantastic, destroyed fx and synths are fantastic, vocals as a whole are fantastic (listening on Bose QuietComforts and hearing drowned vocals in the beginning).  The only complaint I have is the length -- it&#039;s a little short.  It&#039;s a freestyle though, so I understand.  If you&#039;re looking for the go-ahead or approval to put a little more work into it, you have it ten-fold.  This kind of stuff is right up my alley, and I know I&#039;m not the only one.  You should seriously pursue this.

You could charge for this stuff.</column>

            <column name="review">Hey MEG. Trying to get a handle on what it is you are trying to say musically etc. I have listened to 2-3 of your recent uploads and observed some shouts and even clicked a couple of links.  
First of all I am commenting here because there are some moments in this song and others by you that sound good and I also catch some of that enthusiasm when you jam. Some good intensity.
Perhap&#039;s as time goes on I will better able to understand your perspective and how the titles and links to gear relate. Giving you an honest 5 on this because it&#039;s decent. I know you are gonna give us more and better still to come.
Good luck!

            <column name="review">Josh, I totally enjoyed this extended track. First off your f/x is very sic on this song. I am not ashamed to say I tripped hard/enjoyed the vocals. Maybe it&#039;s because I met and sat with you guy&#039;s but hearing Grant discuss the intricacies of a smiling _wat and then burst out laughing made me totally crack up. Very funny shit my friend! Ha ha you talking too. I could just picture the look on Grant&#039;s face and you who rarely makes eye contact and speaks very deliberately in person and on the phone.
Ha ha, if you guy&#039;s say M_ke is a p_s_y that is good enough for me. YOU two shot PUS_SY M_ke!!!!
Anyways, Josh you and Grant are two of the sic-est, koolist, trippy-est dudes I have ever met. Sic, sic evil fucks you two belong on the coast man. The City would be perfect for you two. I have no doubt that in a very short time your group of zombie weirdo groupies would make even Marilyn Manson Blush. 
Uhh.. no offense k MM.
LOL 
Anyways, you not returning calls this week or what?

Thank you.  I&#039;ll keep everything you said in mind as I move forward.  It&#039;s nice to be able to count on you for some good advice.

@Randall
Thanks so much for taking the time to explain all that to me.  I could definitely use some better gear... ASIO does a pretty good job of controlling latency-- I&#039;m down to 12ms or so recording, I just need to break the vocal chords in a bit better.  I&#039;d love to hear your work.</column>

            <column name="review">Your mastering is great as always makes me want to try audition. I liked the environment. the first verse of vocals hit me wrong maybe it was the lyrics, the second ones that came in with the fuzzed image overlaying them panned slightly left and right I liked better and then the vocals clicked in more for the rest of the song. the general song and electronics were good but I think it could be improved on with a traditional instrument like a guitar or piano melody and maybe a repeating type chorus vocal part of the track. but as a general art piece that aims at the ethereal and that type of vibe I like it the way it is, I guess it just depends on what you were going for.</column>

            <column name="review">Well in retrospect of having a big part in this song . I like it alot more now .. Jon a.k.a starfukker and &amp;quot; Digital Syn &amp;quot; sent me some freestyle Piano he recorded . It was staticy and recorded with a mic off of a keyboard .
It was around 10 minutes long and i narrowed it down with my favorite parts .. the Concept was about a guy like me at the time .. Depressed and wanting to let go of life . he would then sit at the bottom of a dried up reservoir durring a long thunderstorm with heavy downpore ... He would then sit and wait for the reservoir to fill .. And slowly let himself drown without a fight . Without a care .. He doesn&#039;t even move .. I used a few noise filters on the track , and a dynamic EQ , and a few samples of storms and water being poored .. I then seqenced them in order .. Like a lake filling up ...  Now there is a nine Inch nails song after this was made called Lights in the sky ... With lyrics saying &amp;quot; watching you drown , Ill follow you down  , and i am here right beside you &amp;quot; .. I sometimes wonder if Trent himself was inspired by this .. If so .. A NINinspiration caused a Faninspiration .. Full circle ..</column>

            <column name="review">Very good , and the song getts better as it goes along .. Big ups to you for using a shitty laptop mic and making the best of it .. The only downside is the scale you use for your vocals .. Try mixing it up more , and dont be scared to sing in a lower octive .. Widen you scale with your vocals and but a mic , a compressor/limiter , and maybe a vocal effects processor , and a interface/soundcard with zero latency monitoring, and you will be less limited and your songs im sure will be a 10 each time .. Sounding good during production is way less time consuming then post production .. I have beaten dead horses for years , i know  .. On another note ..

Dude i use the same 2 programs for my project sick messiah .. getting a presonus firestudio soon to fight latency .. Anyhow with the right setup you can rewire FL8 into a track on adobe ... Do you do this ??</column>

You&#039;ve got a good voice and I&#039;m not saying to take lessons or anything but if there was one aspect that could be improved it would be that. So i dont know if it conflicts with what your original intent of the song, but adding better vocals that really stress communication of the words would help. Again, i know you know ur stuff and ur not monotone or anything, but i think thats where the problem lies. Otherwise, i like it and feel free to use the site as a testing ground.</column>

            <column name="review">This is my remix. Figured I&#039;d give a little background. In 2000 NIN was holding a contest to remix this track. They had a flash app up on their site with something like 8 tracks that all played at the same time. You basically had a volume slider for each track, you hit play and mixed on the fly hoping you were sliding a certain track up at the right time. lol. Very little control. Not like these guys who are remixing stuff from source tracks NIN released in later years.

Anyway. I did this mix on the fly and recorded it to my minidisk while I was doing it. Later I recorded back to my machine and a few years later decided to submit it to ninremixes. If I remember right, it was the first &amp;quot;The Big Come Down&amp;quot; remix submitted to the site. 

I&#039;m not a musician and I don&#039;t even pretend to be. I make indie films so if I ever do audio mixing it usually involves just dialog. In fact I don&#039;t even think I submitted this mix to the contest because I just didn&#039;t feel confident enough about it. 

I have a sneaking suspicion though, that some of these other remixes of The Big Come Down have used my version (along with the original song) as part of their source material. Which is totally cool. More than cool actually, because if true, it makes me feel good I could help out.

I really like this one, Thankyou JRC!
I was afraid it wasn&#039;t going anywhere, but then you changed it up in the middle.
If you meant this as a club mix, I think it&#039;s great.

The only thing I would suggest is pump up the vocals some more, because I love screaming the vocals to March Of The Pigs.

Keep up the good work!</column>

That having been said I did think the bass was a little phat in places and that prevented me from going as loud as I wanted too. 
Hope to hear an update on this sometime down the road.

That having been said I do feel regret that a young person has any type of preoccupation with killing. 
Ok and now that that the preaching is out of the way I would encourage two things. One is too always look long and hard and be sure whoever the target is does not have an NIN tattoo.
Believe me us fans come in all shapes and sizes, at least at the Shoreline in Mountain View we do.
The second thing is please give us some more song before things get outta hand.
Pretty good LT!

Star-ed you the other day but I didn&#039;t know what to say. Still don&#039;t but this is a real good listen. 
I&#039;m so biased having met you guy&#039;s out there. If these other listeners and contributors had a chance to move and sit with you they would be big fans too.
I mean you guy&#039;s got middle class industrial rockers written all over you in person.

            <column name="review">Interestingly enough reading H&#039;s comments actually added to the listen.
Often it&#039;s the other way around but some of his stuff is so sic that you end up not giving a rip that he&#039;s pissed at everyone and thinks we all suck 99 percent of the time. 
Listen when a guy say&#039;s &amp;quot;Is what I was made for&amp;quot; then I have to take a closer examination. 
And given that perspective.. ya this does kick a little ass. I guess we need some of our rock stars to angry a lot of the time. Still I have to wonder what it&#039;s like to sit down and get a little smoke in the air with a guy like H.  
FU H!

Overall I dig it. Wish the vocals were up much more throughout. I need my rocksTaR front and center.  Plus it takes away from the sic-ness when he sounds quieter than the music.
Seems like this would be a great track to add whispers, panning, escalation and more more more of TR.

Well this is a big stupid mistake on my part. How do I rectify this?
By the way here is my explanantion, umm, not it matters.
During the last two weeks I downloaded the multitracks for Burn. 
Thought they would be in Garageband format but were in Flac instead. So I converted in Audacity and also cropped length sure that it would be no problem to align by ear. Subsequently it was a problem. Imported your track from my iTunes intending to use it to align the vocals in my mix project. Wanted to find that power spot where TR says I&#039;m gonna burn this whole thing down. 
Damn I thought I muted/deleted but just opened project and there is your song minus the middle.
Yikes!!

            <column name="review">I love the vocals and the guitars in this. The Lyrics are also really cool. Well hard to rate this, because I always have my remix in ear. I am not really sure about the strings. I think the strings don&#039;t fit for me. Otherwise a good song
8/10

            <column name="review">I liked it for the most part .. i would enjoy recording some real drums for you to mix into the track , or to dub into the track at least .. I felt the ending could of went someplace musically to end it on a different note .. I liked the vocal effects but felt the singing could of been a little louder .. Just slightly .. Not in volume in the mix but in actually volume from your voice .. The low end on the kick drum could be turned way up .. from 20hz to 70 hz up about 10 db .. Good lyrics man .. I can feel it .. </column>

            <column name="review">Sounds a little better than the last mix...vocals sync up a bit better, though still at times seem out of place.

As for the &amp;quot;remix/inspired&amp;quot; debate, however, to me this is still a remix. Fan-inspired songs, in my opinion, are a projects that artists/bands have pieced together with programming, vocals, instruments, etc., made by them. If this were to be vocals of his from HtDA, that may be one thing, but since these are samples from a NIN song, I&#039;d have to put this in the Unofficial category.

I have always thought you had a distinct and sic sounding vocal.  Would like very much to get a solo v track from you and mix into a project. 
It:s great that you don:t record in a manner that over commits to the spacial area of the stereo field.
Very good to see you around!
Look for my message regarding the other thing we talked about before the holidays. Will be sending you a few image possibilities.
Good luck!</column>

This sounds finished! IMO an album full of this would probably be viable. I think a more defined chorus would help to push it a little further and portion it to make it a little easier to digest for listeners new to your style, but I think anyone used to the budding hip-hop industrial subgenre would easily eat this up.

            <column name="review">Great Job really unique. Great synth work and edits. This is probably one of the better remixes I&#039;ve heard yet on this site. The second half of the track is very different. I&#039;d like to hear the first half drop in to something minimal and bassy. Keep that experimental vibe too.
very nice job just lacks a bit of coheason...you would love Mu records.</column>

            <column name="review">This thing kicks ass! Very unortodox! Doesn&#039;t have that loop based repeatability vast majority of remixes have, which can be very annoing. This remix(or should i say remake?) sounds like areal song. Very dynamic with a lot of changes throughout. It has a nice dark pscychedelic feel to it. Not to mention that it uses very few original tracks and most of it seem to be live played instruments. One word CREATIVE!</column>
